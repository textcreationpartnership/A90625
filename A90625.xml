            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And now (Deare friends) I beſeech you reſt not ſatisfied without a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion [from the Spirit of Adoption] that God is your Father.

If thou meeteſt with thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, give glory to the God of heaven; if the bleſſing of the Goſpell drop but from one leafe, or line, upon thy Spirit in thy conſulting it, thy paines are recompenced.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Spirit of the Lord may be redoubled upon the Author, who hath wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in this worke, and that thy profit (who peruſeſt it) may be anſwerable to the deſires and travaile of his ſoule, ſhall be the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of us who are meaneſt among the Saints, who yet deſire to approve our ſelves faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to Chriſt, his truths, his intereſts and his people; ſo we bid thee farewell.

                  <p>And now, the Lord having given me much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in this ſearch, more then ever I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, about the Doctrinall part, and delivered me from many perplexities and feares, which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I laboured under, least I ſhould take that for an evidence, which was none: I am hereby encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to hope, that theſe Directions may be uſefull unto others, in the ſame wayes that they have been
<pb facs="tcp:119891:7"/>to me. Yet the ſpeciall Concurrences of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit onely, can make them effectuall to a ſoule for their proper end.</p>
                  <p>And thoſe experiences of that more Immediate teſtimonie of the Spirit (which thou findeſt in the latter end of the booke) coming to my hand (by an eſpeciall providence) when I had well nigh fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the Treatiſe, and carrying with them ſuch a harmony unto what the Lord had convinced me of before, from his Word, (yet was almoſt diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for publiſhing, becauſe I had found ſo little thereof in my owne experience) theſe have not onely added much Confirmation to me in the truth it ſelfe, but alſo have given me much encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a proceeding in the worke.</p>
                  <p>The Treatiſe (by a bleſſing from heaven) may be uſefull.</p>

The ſwaying, prevailing part of the heart muſt be Chriſt-ward, elſe their faith is vaine, they are yet in their ſinnes. And
<pb facs="tcp:119891:8"/>hence we read ſo often of Converſion, and turning to the Lord — and that as a diſtinguiſhing thing of Saints from others. <hi>Jam. 5.20. Math. 18.3, 4. Act. 3.19. Pſal. 51.13. Ezek. 18.30.32. Act. 14.15. Act. 26.18.20.</hi>

                     <hi>2.</hi> To thoſe which are in a ſtate of grace: it may be of advantage to them, towards peace, joy, Comfort, eſtabliſhment — and let them beware of diſowning any teſtimonie from the Spirit, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that Immediate way or otherwiſe. It is an ordinary ſaying, that wicked men would have Chriſt for their Saviour, but not for their Lord. And I grant, that none doe rightly take Chriſt for Salvation, but alſo doe take him for Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but if hereby they intend to make receiving of Chriſt [as Lord] the onely Evidence of intereſt in him; I conceive they are much miſtaken; for, [Blood] is made a witnes of Adoption, as well as [Water]. And I am confident there is no hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie willingneſs in any unrenewed ſoule to have Chriſt for a Saviour. <hi>Joh. 5.40. Hebr. 2.3.</hi> Receiving Chriſt as a Saviour is as diſtinguiſhing, as receiving him as a Lord. But, there may be ſome kinde of willingnes to receive him either way, yet if it be not an effectuall, heartie willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, it is not evidencing; of which ſee more in the Treatiſe it ſelfe.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:119891:8"/>
                  <p>And now Reader, ſearch the Scriptures, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the things be ſo or not.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a worke whereby the Spirit doth that towards the clearing up unto a ſoule of its Adoption, that a witnes doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men for the deciſion and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a matter dubious and uncertaine.</p>
                     <p>Now, the uſe of a witnes is, to give in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon knowledge, how the matter in queſtion ſtandeth, purpoſely to aſcertaine others thereof. <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.16. The end of witneſſing is expreſſed to be, that a matter may be eſtabliſhed or confirmed and made to ſtand as firme and true, by that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord which is given in. And hence, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.17. The teſtimony of two men is true. <hi>i. e.</hi> is to be received as a ſufficient evidence, and may free from doubting. It was certaine in it ſelfe before, and by the teſtimony it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred certaine unto thoſe that queſtioned it. And, when the Spirit by ſome operations, doth what is equivalent unto this, then is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119891:13"/>witneſſeth. The ſpeakings of the Spirit are in a way ſutable to it ſelfe who is the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and to the ſoule which is ſpoken to, and therefore by operations, not by voyce.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Objectively: when it affordeth ſuch ſpeciall operations, as have an aptitude to aſcertaine the ſoule of its Adoption. There are ſome ſpeciall and remarkeable Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of the Spirit, which by a due obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might manifeſt adoption, and carry with them the force of affirmations and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions thereof. But many overlooke theſe evidences, and will not heare what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſaith unto them. A ſoule may remaine without a knowledge of its Son-ſhip, after the Spirit hath thus witneſſed, if its record be not received. So <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18. <hi>I teſtifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every man that heareth the words</hi> — and yet every man to whom he speaketh this, doe not beleeve what is aſſerted. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Wee teſtifie—and ye receive not our witnes.</hi> It is but a teſtimony propoſed or offered, and is not effectual unleſſe received.</p>
                     <p>And, if nothing further were intended in the Text, yet it were a Mine with much ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual treaſure layd up in it. Severall things of great importance ariſe from this. As,
<list>
                           <item>1. Hence, a knowledge of Adoption is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineable:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119891:13"/>it is the very end of the Spirits witneſſing to aſſure thereof. It is not to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God more aſſured who are his Children, he knoweth who are his. Nor to make Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion certaine in it ſelfe; that muſt be, before it can be witneſſed. But, its ſcope, drift and deſigne is, to leave us aſſured or perſwaded of it. And that it ſhould never attaine its end in this, when it is ſo ſucceſſull in other workes, how unconceivable a thing is it?</item>
                           <item>2. Hence, it is a duty of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to receive that teſtimony which the Spirit offereth: may not the Spirit complaine unto many Chriſtians, as Chriſt did? <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.11. <hi>So, I have teſtified that you were the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and you have not received my witnes.</hi> Doubtles, it is a ſinfull neglect in thoſe that are ſpoken to, not no yeild attention unto the voyce of the Spirit which ſpeaketh. It is urged as a choyce duty, and enforced by a powerful argument, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5 9. <hi>If ye receive the witnes of men, how much more is a divine teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be received, which is farre greater?</hi> and it is the witnes of the Spirit he intendeth, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.8.10.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſtians reckon it a ſmall matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the appearances of Goſpell grace, and to call the ſpeciall operations of the Spirit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions of Satan: O but hereby, you not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinder your owne peace, comfort and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119891:14"/>which might come in at that doore; but, which is farre worſe, you <hi>grieve the Spirit of God alſo,</hi> Eph. 4.30. I may ſay to ſuch as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 7.13. <hi>Is it a ſmall thing for you to weary, grieve, and diſquiet your owne Spirits, but will you grieve the Spirit of my God alſo?</hi> Its ſad enough that carnal men deny attention to the voyce of the Spirit, O let not Chriſtians make it ſpeake in vaine alſo, or miſſe of its end in ſpeaking to them.</p>
                     <p>But, I ſuppoſe this is not all which the Text aymeth at, or intendeth. Therefore.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Spirit witneſſeth efficiently: it cauſeth the ſoule to conclude of its Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by its ſpeakings to it. As Calling, doth often expreſſe not onely an Inviting to a participation of Goſpel grace, but the ſoules anſwering thoſe Invitations, which is effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Calling, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.30. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.14. So, witneſſing expreſſeth an effectual, effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious witneſſing. And, that this is intended in the Text may appeare.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the Context: the ſcope of the Apoſtle is, to give a knowledge of this, who are in Chriſt, &amp; ſo have freedome from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. And this he cleareth, <hi>v.</hi> 5.9.13, 14. But leaſt they ſhould doubt or queſtion, whither they found a mortification of ſin by the Spirit; or injoyed the leadings of the Spirit or not. In the laſt place he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119891:14"/>this as the higheſt, ſureſt, and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible meanes to helpe a ſoule unto a ſight of its intereſt in Chriſt. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelfe witneſſeth with our Spirit</hi> &amp;c. The other workes are of a witneſſing nature, but this is beyond all other helpes; this maketh the other evidencing, and giveth ſights of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from condemnation, and of our Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. So that the Context favoureth this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the words of the Text: the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is ſaid to witnes with our Spirit. Its teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, irreſiſtibly overcometh our Spirit. <hi>i.e.</hi> or Conſcience, it cauſeth them to conclude theſame thing; and ſo there is a joynt-teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Some times the Spirit uttereth its voyce, and our Spirits hold off: but our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are fetched in and made uſe of in this way of witneſſing, which is intended in the Text; both agree in this numericall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion <hi>[That we are the Children of God]</hi> and ſo it is an efficacious witneſſing.</p>
                     <p>I might cleare it from what followeth, <hi>ver.</hi> 33.38. and from other Scriptures, which call the perſwaſion, or Concluſion of the thing which is witneſſed, a witneſſing, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.22. <hi>All beare him witnes.</hi> i.e. Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſame thing with approbation and allowance. But I ſhall proceed to a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which will further diſcover what it is for the Spirit to witnes.</p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:119891:15"/>
                     <p>It is for the Spirit by ſome manifeſt,<note place="margin">What it is for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> and ſpecial acts and operations of its own, to aſcertaine a ſoule by the word or Goſpell of its Adoption. Or, it is for the Spirit by cleare irradiations, and other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual operations with the word, to worke a particular ſoule (by direct or reflexive acts) into a knowledge, perſwaſion, or Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its acceptation into favour with God.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Witnes [the Spirit] and the thing witneſſed, and wherein the witneſſing worke doth conſiſt.</head>
                     <p>HEre are many things conſiderable; as, 1. Who is the Witnes <hi>[The Spirit]</hi> This is cleare in the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it ſelfe</hi>—The truth of a teſtimony hath a dependance on the fidelity of the witnes: and ſo the Spirit who cannot lye, is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Office unto this worke, that a ſoule might be infallibly aſſured of what is teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: were it any other, it might remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der doubtings, and thinke it too good newes to be true, that it ſhould have God for its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo be a joynt-heire with Chriſt in that exceeding, eternall Weight of glory. O but if the Spirit witneſſeth this, who is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119891:15"/>in all he ſaith, this may give a full Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Son ſhip, or free it from thoſe fears, doubtings, jealouſies and ſuſpitions, which it hath laboured under about this queſtion. This proclaimeth the infinite condeſcention of the Spirit, that it ſelfe who is very God, ſhould ſtoope ſo low as to be a witnes in our matters, who are duſt and aſhes. That the Creator ſhould be a witnes to the creature, this is a high favour indeed.</p>
                     <p>And hereby this teſtimony is differenced.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the Deluſions of Satan: hee is ready to beare falſe witnes to the ſoule, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to lead it into miſtaking Concluſions about its condition: and hearkening to his voyce is extreamely dangerous.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the ſingle teſtimony of our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: I doe not ſay that the Spirit doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes effectually without our Spirits: but the Text plainly maketh two <hi>[the Spirit]</hi> with <hi>[our Spirit].</hi> So that if the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by ſome acts peculiar to it ſelfe, be not in conſociation with cur Spirits, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is moſt unſafe, dangerous, and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. O take heed of truſting the ſingle te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of your owne treacherous Spirits in the bu ſynes of your ſoules for eternity: but if the Holy-Spirits hath fetched in your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and overcome them into a Concluſion of your Adoption, you may ſafely owne it,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119891:16"/>at the mouth of theſe two witneſſes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What is the thing witneſſed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Son-ſhip of particular ſoules: the Spirit doth not onely witnes the truth of ſome Doctrine of the Goſpell; it doth not onely give a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that all which receive Chriſt, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on his name, have authority to become the Sons of God, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. Not barely that ſome, that beleevers, but (ſaith the Text) that <hi>[we]</hi> even we are the children of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Wherein the witneſſing worke doth conſiſt, <hi>viz.</hi> In the Spirits giving manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and working the heart into perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and concluſions of Adoption.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It doth not conſiſt onely in affording ſuch operations as being meaſured by Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell rules doe give aſſertions or affirmations of Adoption: but an effectual witneſſing is here intended, ſuch as indeed cauſeth the matter to be eſtabliſhed, which is, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the end of that witneſſing, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.16.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit eſtabliſheth the ſoule in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of God's Fatherly love through Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38. <hi>I am perſwaded</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Job</hi> 19.25. <hi>I know my redeemer liveth.</hi> And hence it is made one end of our receiving the Spirit,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riu.</hi> 2.12.</note> that <hi>we might know the things that are given us of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.24. <hi>Hereby wee know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit,</hi> 2 Corin. 5.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119891:16"/>
                        <hi>ver.</hi> 1.6. <hi>We know—that we have a building of God</hi>—&amp; <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>Becauſe he hath given us the earneſt of his Spirit, therefore we are alwayes confident</hi>— So that, the Spirit witneſſeth, by giving a knowledge and perſwaſion of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It doth not confiſt in its filling the ſoule with conſolation: many if they finde comfort by a word, then they thinke the Spirit hath witneſſed Adoption, elſe not: whereas, this witneſſing worke may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in a very diſconſolate condition. <hi>Job</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7.8, &amp;c. Here was but little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and yet much aſſurance, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46. There is a want of comfort <hi>[Why haſt thou forſaken me]</hi> and yet not a want of aſſurance; for, with the ſame breath he challengeth propriety in God twice over <hi>[My God, my God].</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed this bleſſed newes doth often fill the heart with joy unſpeakeable and full of glory; but, this conſolation is rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential to the witneſſing of the Spirit, then that which giveth being to it. It is an effect of it, not an ingredient into it, more then other workes of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Teſtification is a different worke of the Spirit from conſolation.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. IN what wayes or how the Spirit doth accompliſh this witneſſing worke. In the Deſcription, the Spirit is ſaid, to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. 1. By its Operations within. 2. By its Word without.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Spirit performeth the Office of a witnes by operations within the ſoule: we are not to expect any apparitions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in any viſible ſhape, to the eyes of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes: or any audible voyce from heaven to our outward ear's, for the aſſuring us of our Adoption. I finde no Rule for theſe. The Spirit giveth a certainty of Adoption by its actings within the ſoule, as well as if a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred witneſſes had affirmed it. As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It maketh an effectual application of witneſſing words, when it teſtifieth by direct acts: the hinting or giving in of a word is not enough, as I ſhall ſhew in another place. But then a word is applyed, when it is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully ſet upon the heart by the Spirit, and is ſo fixed, ſetled, and engraven there, that it becometh an ingrafted word, <hi>James</hi> 1.21. and worketh effectually towards its proper
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119891:17"/>end. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.29. And that it beareth downe all temptations, objections, and unbeleeving reaſonings that were in the ſoule before, againſt what it is called up to, by the word, and ſo is written upon the heart. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. <hi>v.</hi> 33. It is onely the finger of the Spirit that can doe this. 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 3.3.</p>
                     <p>And when there is ſuch an application of a witneſſing word, as the heart is irreſiſtibly overpowered into a perſ waſion of Adoption by it, then it it indeed witneſſing.</p>
                     <p>And ſome of the Saints have found ſuch a ſupernatural power coming alongſt with a word, that th ugh afflictions and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons came; yet, they durſt not, could not but ſay to the Lord, <hi>Doubtles thou art our Father.</hi> Or as, 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 5.1. <hi>We know</hi>—</p>
                     <p>And at ſuch a time the promiſe is as it were holden to the heart; they are knitt and glued together, that untill the Spirit ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth its operations; it is as eaſie to make the ſoule leave the body, as to make this perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Adoption leave the ſoule: as I ſhall ſhew more fully elſe where.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Spirit exciteth and draweth out ſome manifeſt, ſpeciall, gracious acts, when the way of teſtifying is by reflex acts: the Goſpel declareth and determineth ſaith and other graces to be infallible evidences of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption. Now, the Spirit enableth to act
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119891:18"/>theſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. And from theſe by reflex acts, to draw Concſuſions of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I call them [ſpeciall gracious acts] to difference them from thoſe workes of the Spirit unbeleevers may have. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5.6. that have not power to aſſert Adoption, which is a ſpeciall relation: for, nothing common can evidence that which is ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
                     <p>And they muſt be [manifeſt] acts of grace: for, Witneſſes are purpoſely to cleare up a matter which is dark &amp; dubious, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore witneſſing muſt ever be by what is more conſpicuous and apparent: and hence Chriſt referreth the <hi>Jewes</hi> to his workes and the Scriptures. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.36.39. Becauſe they were more viſible to them. And (I conceive) there are many ſecret concurrences of the Spirit, which (though they be ſpeciall workes) yet are not intended for this, but ſome other end; and with the utmoſt diligence a ſoule can uſe, are not capable of being improved unto witneſſing, being themſelves ſo hardly diſcerneable. Yet, I dare not confine aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance unto eminent Saints, I thinke, few or no Chriſtians are ſo weake, that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of all ſuch acts of grace, as may wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to them Adoption, as I ſhall prove af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. But there is a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the operations, and the witneſſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119891:18"/>of the Spirit: theſe muſt have light as well as peculiarneſſe in them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Spirit cauſeth the ſoule to apply it ſelfe unto the uſe of due meanes for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining aſſurance. Sometimes, his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are graduall, or by degrees; the ſoule goeth on ſtep by ſtep towards it, and it may be a great while before it arriveth at it. As, the Spirit may firſt Convince by the word, that a Chriſtian ought to ſeek after, and may attaine unto, more quietnes &amp; eſtabliſhment then yet it ſelfe hath found. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. This part of the will of Chriſt it little mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before. And then (it may be) the Lord removeth out of the way thoſe impediments which formerly hindred Aſſurance: ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueth ſome corruptions, anſwereth ſome doubts, cauſeth it to ſee the groundleſneſſe of ſome feares, it hath laboured under; help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to looke into Satans deſignes that have hindred the worke of Chriſt within it, and to take notice of ſome glorious advantages in the attaining of Aſſurance, which it thought not of before: it ſeeth how it may glorifie God more in ſuch a condition, then it can doe under doubtings, feares, diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings—And thus the Spirit capacitateth the ſoule for ſuch a mercy; So <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. <hi>v.</hi> 9.11.14.17. <hi>Moſes</hi> upon every new grant or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of prayer, taketh advantage to riſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119891:19"/>higher and higher in his requeſts, and at laſt cryeth out. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>I beſeech thee ſhew me thy glory.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 19. compared with <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. <hi>All his goodnes paſſed before him.</hi> So, the Lord cauſeth a ſoule to ſeeke for ſome mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cits, and upon the Lords anſwering ſome deſires, it hath encouragement to goe with a holy boldnes for greater mercies, and at laſt it is enabled to act faith in an eminent way for ſights of Divine glory, and in the face of Chriſt hath theſe alſo. It obtaineth ſome mercies conducing to aſſurance at firſt, and afterwards injoyeth that alſo.</p>
                     <p>I have mentioned this the rather;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe Chriſtians thinke to have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance all at once, upon a ſudden, and are apt to be very much troubled if it commeth not in by the lumpe: whereas, the will of God is, to let it in ſometimes by little and little; and the ſoule may be a long time in attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: this is no matter of diſcouragement that thou haſt it not preſently, if thou be'ſt in the way to it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe many are very ſuſpitious of a teſtimony, if it be not by ſome violent, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull heart-aſtoniſhing alterations: whereas, though ſometimes it be by ſuch invincible operations as doe not leave the ſoule to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome whether it will owne them or not, but overcometh the heart immediately to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119891:19"/>of the teſtimony: yet, at other times the Spirit acteth in a more milde, gentle, and ſecret indiſcernable way; and doth more leave the ſoule to its choyce for owning it or not, and by quenching the motions of the Spirit it may miſſe of that Aſſurance which they lead to. Yet theſe operations when they doc effectually witneſſe, are ſo powerfull, that ever they carry the heart alongſt with them, towards Chriſt. When Aſſurance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in, as the reſult of ſelfe-examination, it may not cauſe ſuch eminent alterations as a ſoule may expect, and yet it may be good. But there are ſweet gracious effects that will follow reall witneſſings of the Spirit, which way ſoever they come in. And that bowing of the heart to the uſe of meanes, as ſelfe-examination &amp;c. is another worke of the Spirit as a witneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Spirit affordeth Irradiations: as a witneſſe openeth a Caſe and ſheweth how it ſtandeth; ſo the Spirit by ſhining forth with its bright, glorious, and heavenly beames into the darke, dungeon-like ſoule, doth cauſe it to diſcerne enough in the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of promiſes, and in the exerciſe of graces, to ſatisfie it about its adoption.</p>
                     <p>And, though it ſeemed to be under a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night of ſpiritual darkneſſe before; yet, when the Spirit hath ſhined upon its owne workes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119891:20"/>in the ſoule, and put new life into former experiences, then it can conclude that the Sun of righteouſneſſe is ariſen upon or in the heart, who was hidden or unſeene till then in a great meaſure. And hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle prayeth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18, 19. <hi>That they might have the Spirit of revelation</hi>—And for what end? <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>That ye may know what is the hope of his calling.</hi> i. e. that you may know upon what certain grounds,<note place="margin">

                     <p n="2">2. The Spirit witneſſeth as by operations within, ſo alſo, by a written word without: this doth contribute much to aſſurance. The Word declareth.</p>

                        <hi>Anſ:</hi> 1. More Immediately by it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By Water.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By Bloud. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5 8.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The Spirit witneſſeth more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by it ſelfe: I ſay [by it ſelfe] not in oppoſition to the written word; but to diſtinguiſh this way of witneſſing, from thoſe by water and bloud, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.8. It is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Spirit with theſe, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them witneſſing to us efficiently: but beſides, the Spirit hath a more Immediate Teſtimonie of its owne, which it affordeth to ſome beleevers, whereby they are filled with ſatisfaction about their Adoption.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes, when they are gaſping after Communion with Chriſt, the Spirit giveth them ſuch ſweet, unexpreſſible, heart-ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring, ſoule-raviſhing manifeſtations of it ſelfe, and of Divine love, as effectually over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh them into an undoubted perſwaſion thereof.</p>
                     <p>Ordinarily, the Spirit maketh uſe of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119891:22"/>written word in this way of witneſſing: he maketh the word without a voyce within; by the effectual application of it unto a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſoule.</p>
                     <p>Or, if it be not by an expreſſe word; yet, it is by ſome Scriptural conſideration, or in or preſently after waiting upon the Lord in wayes of his owne appointment by the Word: as prayer, it may be for the very mercy of Aſſurance, &amp;c. and ſo it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly an Immediate Revelation, becauſe in the uſe of meanes.</p>
                     <p>It may ſeeme very improper to call it Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, and yet aſſert it to be by the Word. But, the expreſſion may be borne withall.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Spirit hath ſuch an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſtroke here, and doth more eminently manifeſt its owne preſence in this, then in the other wayes of witneſſing. Here it wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth not in a Diſcurſive way, by deducing Concluſions from premiſes; but the Spirit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="5 letters">

                        </gap>eth the ſoule, and thereby worketh it into the perſwaſion by a Direct act, without any neceſſary reflexion upon workes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly wrought within. It effectually cauſeth the ſoule to beleeve its Adoption.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe, the Scriptures are called the Word of the Lord, and are the very breath, of the Spirit. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>All Scripture is</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe I uſe the word Immediate to diſtinguiſh this, from the other wayes of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing. Now, that beſides the Spirits wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing by Water. <hi>i. e.</hi> Sanctification, and by Blood. <hi>i. e.</hi> Juſtification, there is ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct way of witneſſing, it may appeare up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe grounds.</p>
                     <p>

It is proper to ſay that a man doth that, which his ſubſtitute or ſervant doth by his appointment:<note place="margin">Not the Spirit, but the Spirit himſelfe: the Graces of the Spirit are witneſſes, as every effect is a witnes of its Cauſe—but the Spirit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth it ſaith the Text. <hi>Symonds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted ſoule, Caſe and Cure.</hi> pag. <hi>453.</hi>
                        </note> a Lord doth many times by his Steward; but, if it be ſaid that [ſuch a man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe] hath performed any worke, that argueth his doing it in his owne perſon, and not by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So, if it were onely <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <p>Faith which is a grace may receive the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie, but the Spirit giveth it, and not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119891:23"/>graces in his ſtead: elſe, it ſhould not be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe properly, but graces for him. As Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>i. e.</hi> Sanctification is called a witneſſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.8. when graces teſtiſie: although it is the Spirit that cauſeth them to doe it, yet the graces have the denomination for the witnes. So here, the Spirit himſelfe is the witnes rather then graces, though graces may be uſed about this, as the Spirit is about the other. And hence after the Apoſtle had told them of the uſefulneſſe of mortification and Conduct, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. for the clearing up of Juſtification and Adoption; yet he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeing that they might queſtion their injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe, as well as their Juſtification; therfore he addeth this as the higheſt meanes for knowledge, which may hold when all others fayle [<hi>The Spirit himſelfe</hi>—].</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 2. From the aptitude of many writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten words or promiſes (by application) to witneſſe: I account it very unſafe to draw up ſuch Concluſions from a Scripture caſt in, as it hath no naturall tendency to enforce; neither in its ſcope or ſence, directly nor by conſequence, neither in the letter of it, nor by application. This miſtake too many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under in theſe dayes. When they be dubious about what is their duty, if a word cometh into their minds, although it tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to reſolve the doubt, looketh not the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119891:23"/>leaſt that way; yet that word is made a rule for action, and the decider of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Whereas if it be applyed by the Spirit, it is intended for ſome other uſe or end, and not for the determination of a matter which is no wayes concerned in that Scripture: For, the Spirit doth not ſpeake barely in letters, ſyllables, or words of Scripture, but as theſe expreſſe things which are agreeable to the minde of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>A man may be prophane, and yet uſe the words of Scripture, and Satan often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth with an, <hi>It is written,</hi> Matth. 4.6. But, there are many Scriptures of a witneſſing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which cannot be denyed this uſe.</p>
                     <p>Here are two things to be confirmed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there is an aptitude in ſome Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to witneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Spirit doth make application of theſe, and that for ſuch ends.</p>

What can ſatisfie a ſoule, if this will not? for the Lord to ſay, <hi>I am thy God.</hi>

                     <p>And to cleare it further.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There are many aſſuring promiſes, of ſpeciall mercies which are conſequential to Adoption: Now, theſe muſt needs have an aptitude by application to give Aſſurance of our intereſt in that which it a neceſſary An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedent: as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 41.10. <hi>I will ſtrengthen thee, I will uphold thee.</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. <hi>My grace is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for thee.</hi> Heb. 13.5. <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. There are many Scriptures that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tend to remove the grounds of a ſoules
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119891:24"/>doubting of its Adoption: as, if it queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its intereſt in Chriſt, becauſe it is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſuch heavy afflictions; theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures tend to remove that doubt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth be chaſteneth.</hi> Rev. 3.19. <hi>As many as I love I rebuke and chaſten.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the variety or violence of temptations which it hath mett withal be the ground of its doubting; it may finde releife from <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.18. <hi>&amp; Hebr.</hi> 4.15. Chriſt was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without ſin: he was free from ſinne, yet was not free from temptation; and ſo Chriſtians may not look for exemption from temptation who abound with ſin: Yea, it is expreſſely ſaid [<hi>we are</hi>] <hi>tempted.</hi> If the feeling ſtrong workings of corruption puts the ſoule upon queſtioning its condition: that may miniſter helpe, that <hi>Paul,</hi> an eminent Saint, groaned under the ſame burden. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. yea, he cryeth out with bitter lamentation, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> And thus, many Scriptures have an aptitude to witneſſe: for it is their proper effect (when applyed by the Spirit) to remove ſuch doubtings of Divine love, as ariſe from ſuch Cauſes, which oftentimes are the onely obſtacles in the way to Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Spirit doth make application
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119891:25"/>of ſuch Scriptures unto particular ſoules, and that for ſuch Ends, may appeare.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From their aptitude to Witneſſe: that word, <hi>Iſui.</hi> 41.10. <hi>I am thy God</hi> — bringeth in God as ſpeaking to a particular ſoule, and telling it of its intereſt in himſelfe: it hath a witneſſing voyce in the very letter of it, and ſo carrieth evidence with it, that this is its proper deſigne. And, that the Spirit doth apply words for the proper ends they ſo clearely point at, is undeniable, eſpecially when the thing pointed at, is undoubtedly a worke of the Divine Spirit, as witneſſing is.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From a parity of reaſon: the Spirit applyeth other words, for thoſe ends which they aptly ſerve to. None will deny but that it may and doth reprove declineing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for leaving their firſt love, by ſuch a word as that <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 3.4.11. Or threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten lukewarme ſoules, by <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.16. Or convince carnally confident ſoules, of the ſadnes of their condition, by <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. <hi>v</hi> 17.22.</p>
                     <p>And, by the ſame reaſon, it ſhould apply the aforementioned Scriptures in a witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing way, unto doubting ſoules: and hence when <hi>David</hi> was beſieged, and ſurrounded on every ſide with troubles, and the Lord ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to keepe ſilence, he even putteth words
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119891:25"/>into the mouth of God. <hi>Pſal</hi> 35.3 [ſay thou] <hi>i. e.</hi> by thy Spirit in ſome word or promiſe; for, this is the Lords way of ſpeaking to the ſoules of his people; and hence it is called often, <hi>the Word of God.</hi> And, it was the Word that <hi>David</hi> hoped in for his ſalvations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.81, 82.</p>
                     <p>He had the letter of a promiſe before, <hi>v.</hi> 28. but this would not ſatisfie him, unleſſe the Lord would ſpeake it over againe, he muſt have it applyed to his inner man, Say [<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

He beggeth here the witneſſings of the Spirit, in the Word, by an effectual application of it, to his ſoule.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From a beleevers right and title to ſuch words or promiſes: Chriſt is his, and all the promiſes of the new Covenant his, in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. Yea, promiſes directed to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons in Scripture, when they are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119891:26"/>about things of generall concernement, doe admit of a generall application, and every beleever may lay claime to them, as his: that promiſe <hi>[I will not faile thee or for ſake thee]</hi> is directed to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Joſh. 1. <hi>v.</hi> 5. yet is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed generally. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. And ſo, generall promiſes are capable of a particular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unto every individual beleever. Now, if the Spirit did not apply them, Chriſtians ſhould miſſe of that proſit and advantage which according to the intent of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer is to be reaped by them.</p>
                     <p>A beleever is adopted,<note place="margin">Iſa. <hi>41.10.</hi> Ezek <hi>36.25</hi>
                        </note> hath God for his God, hath cleane water ſprinkled on him, &amp;c. and the Word doth ſay thus much to him, though in a more ſecret way, in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which he underſtood not. The wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing of the Spirit, is but the uttering theſe things to the ſoule with a more audible voyce. It is but like a Fathers telling his Childe of an eſtate which was really his own before. So, Chriſtians have a propriety in ſuch words or promiſes before, and it is the office of the Spirit to give a knowledge unto beleevers of the things that are freely given them of God. 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 2.12. And ſo, it will apply theſe as well as other words; for, the Goſpell owneth no reſtriction or limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if ſome promiſes were to be applyed, others not. The whole Goſpell is the voyce
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119891:26"/>of the Spirit, and ſo, any word may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed for its proper end, and therefore wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing words as well as other.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. From the appointment of Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for this very end to witneſſe; which muſt be by application from the Spirit: the whole word is often called God's teſtimonie. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 119. <hi>v.</hi> 2.22.24. &amp;c. <hi>&amp; Heb.</hi> 6.18. There are two Immutable things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained on purpoſe to helpe us unto ſtrong conſolation, and they are. 1. Gods promiſe. 2. His Oath. <hi>v.</hi> 13.17. But how doe they bring in this Conſolation? it is by witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, for, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. An Oath is ſaid to be for confirmation, and ſo the two Immutable things bring in this ſtrong conſolation as they ſerve for the ratification and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a ſoule of its intereſt in the bleſſings of the Goſpell. And they are of the ſame uſe to all the heires of promiſe that they were of to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ver. 17, 18. To give them the ſame certainty of what they are heires to, that he had. And both the promiſe and the Oath muſt needs give teſtimonie, by direct rather then reflex acts, as the nature of them doe intimate. By all which it appeareth that Gods promiſe and Oath (both which are without us) doe as properly conduce to the affording Aſſurance of our propriety in Chriſt, and in the everlaſting inheritance by
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119891:27"/>him, as any inherent graces or qualifications can doe.</p>
                     <p>Now, as it was the application to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> of theſe two, that made them witneſſing to him. <hi>Gen</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 12.16, 17. So there muſt be a ſuperadded worke of the Divine Spirit, making an application of them to particular ſoules, as there was to <hi>Abraham;</hi> elſe, they cannot add a confirmation, or bring in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, to any heires of promiſe, which are the ends they are intended for.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 3. From the number of Witneſſes which the Goſpel owneth: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.8 <hi>There are three that beare witneſſe on Earth.</hi> Now, if [the Spirit] ſhould not give a diſtinct teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie from water and bloud, there were not three witneſſes. Indeed, neither water nor bloud are ſufficient alone to witneſſe: but, the Spirit with water make but one witneſſe; and hence the water hath the denomination for the witnes, and not the Spirit. And, the Spirit with bloud make but one witneſſe; and thence the bloud is called the witneſſe, and not the Spirit: and therefore if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit had not a diſtinct way of witneſſing, from its Concurrence with theſe, there were but two, not three witneſſes. And that water ſhould be ſo diſtinct from bloud in the way of its teſtifying, and that the Spirit ſhould not be as diſtinct from them both, is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119891:27"/>and ſoundeth very harſh, I conclude therefore, that the ſame uſe which water or bloud are of,<note place="margin">The Spirit witneſſeth with bloud and with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but beſides the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath a diſtinct wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing, by way of enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoule with joy in the ſoules apprehenſion of Gods Fatherly love. The Spirit doth not alwayes witneſſe unto us our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by force of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from ſanctification; but ſometimes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by way of preſence; as the ſight of a friend comforting without helpe of diſcourſe. <hi>Dr. Sibbs.

                        </note> when they witneſſe; the ſame the Spirit is of, when that witneſſeth. And, as they have ſomething diſtinct from each other, from whence (when diſcerned) a concluſion is drawne of intereſt in Chriſt: ſo, the Spirit hath ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar acts or operations of its owne, diſtinct from both; which effectually beget the ſame perſwaſion which they doe, though in a more Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate way, then if it were by Inferences from ſuch promiſes as they attain it by.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It muſt needs be underſtood of the Divine Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Divine Spirit is a witneſſe on earth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. and ſo the enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Witneſſes on earth, were not full, if that were not intended.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe the ſcope of the Apoſtle in this Chapter is, not to advance our Spirits, but,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119891:28"/>the Divine Spirit as the witneſſe on earth. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6. It is the Spirit that beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, becauſe the Spirit is truth, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he numbreth the witneſſes, <hi>ver.</hi> 7 8. <hi>&amp; ver.</hi> 10 <hi>He that beleeveth hath the witneſſe</hi> [<hi>in himſelfe</hi>] which argueth that his deſigne is, to aſſert the Holy-Spirit to be a witnes on Earth: for, he doth not ſay, he hath the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes [in heaven] but [within himſelfe]. <hi>i. e.</hi> on Earth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe if our Spirits were intended, they muſt be our ſanctified and renewed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and theſe belong to, and are included in the witnes of water, which denoteth ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification: and ſo, unleſſe by Spirit be meant the Holy-Ghoſt, there will yet be, but two, not three witneſſes on Earth, for our Spirits and water make but one.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. From the experience of the Saints: I could name many that have had their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption aſcertained to them by the Spirits applying a written word. Although experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence alone is not argument enough to prove, yet with the former ſpirituall grounds, it may confirme the thing to us.</p>
                     <p>But of this, more in the ſecond part.</p>
                     <p>I have inſiſted more largely upon the prooſe of this, becauſe ſome ſtumble at it, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that Aſſurance is attaineable onely by reflexion upon marks, and ſignes, or Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications within.</p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:119891:28"/>
                     <p>I ſhall anſwer a doubt or two further, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leave this point.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Have not ſome poore ſoules lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in doubtings almoſt all their dayes, in expectation of ſuch a kinde of witnes, and and doe not others dangerouſly erre, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſtrong conceit of their owne phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, for the witnes of the Spirit?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I grant that the Spirit doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes by faith and other graces, and any one of theſe teſtimonies may keepe him that hath it, from languiſhing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Poſſibly, a limiting or tying up the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit unto one way of witneſſing, may be the occaſion of the ſoule diſtreſſe: though asking aſigne was lawfull in it ſelfe, yet when the Phariſees deſired it in a carnal way, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Chriſt to this way, when they had Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and the Scriptures to teſtifie of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this occaſioned a denyal of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 38, 39. Let Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of preſcribing the Lord, and tying him up to one way that they have met with him in, when other meanes are Inſtituted for the ſame end, beſides that.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Many that make inherent Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the onely evidences, yet take their owne phantaſies for theſe. Though diſtracted men ſay that all the houſes and lands they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile by are theirs, yet men in their right
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119891:29"/>mindes may know what is their owne: ſo (as I once heard a ſervant of Chriſt ſay) though bedlam profeſſors may ſay that Chriſt, and eternal life are theirs, when one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their owne phantaſies tell them ſo; yet, it no way followeth thence, that ſuch a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the Spirit is not to be expected.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object</hi> 2. But the three witneſſes. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.8. doe teſtifie Conjunction, together, not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally, or one alone; and ſo the Spirit may witnes with water and bloud; or may put forth ſome diſtinct acts about theſe, and not have a diſtinct way of witneſſing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If ſanctification be diſcerned, I aske whether it will not be granted that this witneſſe is ſufficient? if ſo, then they may witneſſe ſeverally, and it is not neceſſary that the three be alwayes together in witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. And why may not the Spirit alſo be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in witneſſing, who is the higheſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This was anſwered before: Water and bloud are different in their wayes of witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; and therefore alſo the Spirit different from them both; becauſe a third and chiefe witnes.</p>
                     <p>Yet, I deny not but that Graces may wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at the ſame time, when this more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate teſtimonie is afforded. That light which is darted in, may diſcover graces, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119891:29"/>former experiences; yet, the Immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Spirit ſo gloriouſly accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the worke, that the ſoule doth not, or not primarily, Conclude from theſe graces, for the preſent: yet, afterwards when the Spirit hath ſuſpended its operations, then the remembrance of theſe may confirme, and evidence that it was really the Spirit, which did bow it into that perſwaſion, and may difference it to others from all deluſions. And, it is neceſſary to underſtand that theſe belong unto the other wayes of witneſſing; leaſt the want of a diſtinct knowledge of one from the other, ſhould hinder a reception or owning of reall teſtimonies, when water or bloud lie dark.</p>
                     <p>And this is the firſt way of the Spirits wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing.</p>

                     <p>And, that the Spirit doth witnes unto ſoules their intereſt in Chriſt, by ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is evident.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is expreſſely called a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.8. and there could not be three, if that were not one.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is reckoned up amongſt the peculiar priviledges and ſpeciall favours which the Saints receive from Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified</hi>—Where it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenceth their ſtate of Converſion to Chriſt, from their ſtate of nature wherein they were without Chriſt. And it is attributed to the Spirit, which is therefore frequently called <hi>the [holy] Spirit;</hi> becauſe it worketh holineſs in the hearts of men.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p n="1">1. That Water. <hi>i. e.</hi> Sanctification cannot witnes Adoption without the Irradiations of the Spirit: when a Chriſtian hath had ſome ſweet, lively, experience of God, ſome ſenſible injoyment of him, and a feeling of the Spirits operations, exciting, quickening, and acting its owne graces; yet by and by, when this light from the Spirit is wanting, it is ready to throw away all againe, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119891:31"/>ſay, O I thought I had ſeen God in ſuch a way, and heard his voyce, and felt his love; but now I feare I was miſtaken: and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when the Spirit ſhineth upon its owne workes againe, then it can owne God in the ſame diſpenſations that it caſt away; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. The Prophet was in great affliction and diſtreſſe; <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>My ſnare ran in the night and ceaſed not, my ſoule refuſed to be comforted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as a Remedy. 1. <hi>He remembred God, v.</hi> 3. i.e. called to minde how gracious and mercifull the Lord is; and this in ſtead of eaſing did aggravate his ſorrowes. 2. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected former experiences, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the dayes of old.</hi> i.e. what the dealings of God had been with me, how gracious he had been to me formerly; and he thought to have mitigated his griefe this way; but the light of the Spirit was wanting; and ſo in ſtead of aſſwaging, this heightneth his trouble, that he is ruſhed almoſt upon a brinke of deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>ver.</hi> 7.8, 9. <hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever? will he be favourable no more? hath he forgotten to be gracious?</hi> But, he hath a ſecond remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Gods dealings of old, <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11. and is cheered up by them, &amp; could admire God in them againe, <hi>v.</hi> 13. There was a great dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes upon his old experiences, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and then they were wounding to him; but the Spirit ſhineth upon the ſame, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. and then they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119891:31"/>tend to healing. So that, when the beames of that Sun are afforded, then a ſoule may trace the footſteps of the Almighty, from one particular to another, and ſay, God was here, to ſuccour me under this temptation, to ſupport me in this condition, to ſanctifie to me this diſpenſation, though I was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of it, and then Graces within may be witneſſing, elſe not.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That Sanctification is a darker evidence, then the other: this water is many times muddy. There is ſo much imperfection in it; ſuch ſtirrings of corruption, yea prevailings, even in the beſt of the Saints, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. that this evidence is often darkned, and blotted, and hath but a moon-light in it. There is a perfection in the other witneſſes, though there may be imperfection in their witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: but, here is much weaknes in the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes it ſelfe of water, which affordeth more cauſe of queſtioning it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But may or can a ſoule injoy any other teſtimony, by the Spirit or bloud, when water. <hi>i.e.</hi> Sanctification lyeth dark?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ:</hi> 1. A certainty that Sanctification is wanting ſpeaketh an incapability of having Adoption witneſſed any way to a man: for, the want of that doth infallibly evidence a want of Adoption. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>He that committeth ſin.</hi> i.e. liveth and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119891:32"/>walketh in ſin, and is addicted and given up to the ſervice of it <hi>[he is of the Devil] ver.</hi> 4. <hi>for he that is borne of God cannot ſin</hi>—Such are expreſſely excluded from the inheritance of Sons. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>Neither fornicatours, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, — nor theeves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners ſhall inherit the kingdome of God: nor no unrighteous ones.</hi> ver. 9. Whereas, all that are adopted are heires of that Kingdome. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32. And this may caſt the carnal confidences of multitudes in theſe dayes, who are without reſtraining grace, and yet pretend to aſſurance; who live in prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and thoſe very ſins afore-mentioned, and yet are confident of their intereſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, which is expreſſely to give the Holy-Ghoſt the lye,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor</hi> 6.10.</note> which ſaith, <hi>they ſhall not enter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it can on Scripture grounds be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that a man is deſtitute of faith or repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance &amp;c. then it is certaine that he hath no teſtimony from the Spirit of Adoption.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But Sanctification may be inevident, or lie darke, and yet the Spirit or bloud may witnes Adoption: A man may not be able clearely or diſtinctly to diſcerne his Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, it may be clouded, and be very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure to him, and yet the Spirit or bloud may teſtifie his intereſt in Chriſt. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119891:32"/>
                        <hi>ver.</hi> 20.22. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.4. He may be able by the light of the Spirit to ſee acts of faith put forth upon the bloud of Chriſt, and theſe are witneſſing. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 1.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.10.</p>
                     <p>And the Spirit and bloud are the higheſt witneſſes, and ſo afford the cleareſt evidences of Adoption.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Yet a man may and ought by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence Conclude of his Sanctification when ever the other witneſſes are afforded: as in a darke day a man may conclude that the Sun is up, though he cannot ſee it: ſo, a man, ſeing acts of faith on the bloud of Chriſt, may conclude he is ſanctified, though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee his owne ſanctification: and the not drawing this Concluſion is the occaſion of many feares, dejections, diſquietings, and diſcomforts in the ſoules of many Sainte.</p>

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 3. THe Spirit witneſſeth by bloud: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.8. i.e. the bloud of Chriſt, by which we have Redemption, Remiſſion, Juſtification, — <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.9.</p>
                     <p>The righteouſneſſe of Chriſt and his bloud
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119891:33"/>are all one: and hence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. <hi>We are juſtified by his bloud;</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Juſtified by his righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, that this bloud doth performe the office of a Witneſſe is evident.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Becauſe it is called a Witnes, and that in way of diſtinction from water, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5 8.</item>
                        <item>2. Becauſe bloud is uſefull to ſuch ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ends as are peculiar to thoſe in Chriſt: as Juſtification — <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.13. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25.</item>
                        <item>3. Becauſe the application of this bloud is by faith, which hath an aptitude to make it witneſſing: we are not to imagine that this bloud can witnes unto any particular ſoule its Adoption without it be appropriated and applyed by ſome ſpeciall acts which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the world want, becauſe many obtaine not Adoption or ſalvation by it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8, 12. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. And without ſuch acts it would witnes it to all the world as well as to any one in it.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Now it is the office of faith, to make that generall, of Chriſts ſhedding his bloud for the redemption &amp; reconciliation of ſinners, to be of particular advantage to a ſoule. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. It is the bloud that Juſtifieth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. And therefore bloud is called the witneſſe and not faith. But, ſeing it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by faith, that may diſcover when it is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119891:33"/>applyed, and ſo may make it witneſſing: and hence he that beleeveth is ſaid to have the witneſs within himſelfe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. And we are ſaid to be <hi>Juſtified by faith,</hi> Rom. 3. <hi>v.</hi> 28.30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. And there is an inſeparable connexion made between faith and ſalvation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16.36. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. All which prove, that bloud (which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in thoſe priviledges) hath a power gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it to witnes.</p>
                     <p>Much therefore are they miſtaken, that take Sanctification and inherent Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be the onely witneſſing things: you ſee the bloud of Chriſt, which is without us, given, imputed, or applyed to us, is alſo a witneſſe, as well as graces within us. I take bloud, to be a clearer evidence then Water, which is often muddy and full of imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and hence ſuch an Emphaſis, is put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bloud. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6. <hi>He came not hy water onely, but by water and blood.</hi> His ſaying <hi>[not by water onely]</hi> argueth that it is the bloud, he would have eſpecially taken notice of, and that it was for the ſake of bloud, that this is iterated. Men are apt to ſlight bloud, as if that deſerved not the name of a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; whereas, although water is not to be neglected, yet bloud is moſt to be minded, or more then water in this witneſſing worke,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119891:34"/>for he ſtriveth moſt to advance that witneſſe <hi>[not by Water onely —].</hi>

                        <hi>Qu:</hi> 3. VVHo are capable of attaining the witneſſings of the Spirit? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Onely beleevers are in a capacity to injoy ſuch a teſtimonie from the Spirit: for, onely they are adopted, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26. <hi>Ye are the children of God by faith.</hi> There muſt be adoption, before it can be witneſſed to a ſoule that it is Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; elſe there is a bearing falſe witneſſe, which cannot (without blaſphemie) be charged upon the Spirit of truth, who is the witneſſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6.</p>
                     <p>That ſome eminent beleevers may and doe attaine the witneſſings of the Spirit is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Job</hi> 19.25. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. And often we reade of Confidence and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Weake beleevers are capable of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the witneſſings of the Spirit about their Adoption: this poſition is queſtioned by ſome, yet becauſe the denyal of it doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119891:34"/>tend to raiſe diſcouragement in their way to ſeeking after it (becauſe it is in vaine to attempt things impoſſible) and ſeing the very knowledge of a poſſibility of attaining it, is very comfortable, and the thing it ſelfe much more: hence I thought good to offer ſome reaſons, which for the preſent, ſatisfie me, that it is not a priviledge intended by Chriſt, onely for the talleſt Cedars in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, or thoſe that are ſtrong ones, but alſo ſuch as are weake in the faith, have this Legacy bequeathed to them by the will of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Yet before I lay downe my grounds, I ſhall premiſe ſome things, which will make way for them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prem:</hi> 1. The witneſſings of the Spirit may be attaineable, and yet not be attained: Chriſtians are without much of that ſweete Communion which they might injoy with the Lord Chriſt; he knocked, called, &amp; cryed to the Spouſe, <hi>Open to me my ſiſter, my love— Cant.</hi> 5.2. But ſpiritual ſloth, and carnal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie ſhut the doore againſt him, and he withdrew himſelfe, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.6. Here fellowſhip with Chriſt was not attained, and yet was attaineable. I doe not undertake to prove that every weake beleever doth injoy effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al witneſſings (though much might be ſaid for that) but I am onely to prove that they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119891:35"/>are attaineable, even by babes in Chriſt. If they choake, ſmother, and quench the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit, that (if followed up and cheriſhed) might have been witneſſing; and through negligence about the uſe of meanes, or temptations &amp;c. may goe without them, yet this ſpeaketh not their incapacity for the injoyment of them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I ſhall endeavour to prove that thoſe which are really weake; not onely, in gifts and naturall abilities, but even in graces al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; yet, are in a capacity to attaine the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſings of the Spirit: and therefore, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous for men to deſpaire of them, becauſe they are weake in their owne appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions; ſeing, they may miſ-judge about their meaſure, and may be ſtrong in the grace of Chriſt; and however, reall weaknes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth not matter of diſcouragement.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The witneſſings of the Spirit may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of degrees: as its operations are at one time more potent, conſpicuous and manifeſt then at another, ſo may the ſoules perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its Adoption be, which are raiſed by theſe.</p>
                     <p>The appearances of the Spirit at one time may be ſo glorious, and its actings ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; as, all doubtings, feares, or queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings about its ſtate may be cruſhed, ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and baniſhed, that if men and Angels
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119891:35"/>ſhould labour to bring under a contrary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, yet it durſt not, it could not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39. Yet, at other times they may not be ſo cleare, or irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but liable to quenchings by ſmaller meanes. I ſhall not at preſent aſſert that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſings in thoſe high degrees are attaineable by weake beleevers: theſe may ſeeme to be too ſtrong meates for them to beare. But, that they are capable of freedome in ſome meaſure from their doubtings, and of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome degree of perſwaſion that Chriſt is theirs, this I am to prove.</p>
                     <p>The rich mans window may be wider then the poore mans, and ſo the Sun may make his houſe more lightſome, that the things within it, may be more clearely diſcerned there: but the poore man may really injoy the beames of the Sun, and know that they come from it, and may ſee what is in his houſe, as well as he. So, the pooreſt Saint may know that the Spirit hath ſhined in his heart, as well as others, that are beholden to it, for brighter beames then he hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. An eminent meaſure of grace is of great advantage towards Aſſurance: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6.8.10. Therefore this affordeth no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement unto any to content themſelves with that meaſure, which they are come up
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119891:36"/>to. Nay, the witneſſings of the Spirit will be furtherances, and provocations unto grow'th in grace, if really injoyed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. But yet, a high meaſure of grace is not ſo neceſſary to Aſſurance, but that a weake beleever (in the uſe of meanes) may actaine it, as well as other mercies, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne him in his well-being.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I deny not, that a weake Chriſtian at ſome particular times may hinder himſelfe of ſuch a mercy: but this is common to him with eminent Saints: for, they may (by nouriſhing ſome curruption) weaken, if not looſe, theſe witneſſings of the Spirit, when they have injoyed them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8.12. Theſe are extraordinary hindrances, I am to prove an ordinary capacity. Neither doe theſe, ſo incapacitate, as to forbid ſeeking after wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſings: for, <hi>David</hi> when upon ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he had loſt the joy of his ſalvation; yet, with that intermediate duty of Repentance and pleading for cleanſing. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>v.</hi> 2.7. he beggeth alſo that his joy might be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>v.</hi> 12.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. I am not about to prove the duration of theſe witneſſings, but the capability of weake beleevers to attaine them, how little while ſoever they laſt: I doe not aſſert their having ſuch a conſtant certainty of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as ſhould perpetually put them beyond
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119891:36"/>doubtings: the multiplicity, and variety of temptations which they are ſubject to, and their weaknes, and unskilfulnes to reſiſt the tempter, may occaſion a ſpeedy loſſe of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: their want of experience in thoſe wayes which tend to the ſtrengthening and cheriſhing of this perſwaſion; together with that great ſuſpition which they have over their owne hearts, and thoſe heart-amazing workings of corruption, which (by after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions upon themſelves) they take notice of; theſe, may quickly deprive of theſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſings againe.</p>
                     <p>And, indeed with many eminent Saints, they are not long-laſting. They are but the paſſings by of the Lord before their ſoules. They have a ſoule-raviſhing view of God and Chriſt, by the light of the Spirit; but, they are ſoon out of ſight againe. They muſt not thinke of building Tabernacles when they are upon this high mountaine behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glory of Chriſt on it. A large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grace, is of great advantage towards the continuance and preſervation of theſe: but, though they laſt but for a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet it is an unſpeakable favour that they are afforded.</p>

It is not ſaid, he that is an eminent beleever, but <hi>he that beleeveth;</hi> not hereafter ſhall have, <hi>but [hath] the witnes within himſelfe.</hi> This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition were not univerſally true, if the weakeſt beleever were at any time deſtitute of it. Neither is it ſaid he hath the Spirit, but he hath [the witnes] <hi>i.e.</hi> the Spirit as a witnes; or for this end to be a witnes to him. And how harſh doth it ſound that weake beleevers, ſhould be uncapable of attaining the end of its being preſent with them as a witneſſe, without which it ſhould neither performe its office, nor anſwer its name.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> It may performe the office of a witnes, or be a witnes-bearer to all beleevers objectively, by graces &amp; operations, though they ſee or know it not: as a Landmarke, or ſheep-mark, witneſſe whoſe the land or ſheep are: though not efficiently; as a Landmarke
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119891:37"/>or Sheep-mark is not alwayes diſcerned. Or, the thing witneſſed here, is, onely <hi>[that Chriſt is the Son of God]</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6.10. Not, that this or that particular ſoule is intereſted in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That witneſſing to particular ſoules, their Adoption, and that efficiently. <hi>i.e.</hi> ſo as to give them a knowledge of it, is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as well as, that Chriſt is the Son of God, may appeare theſe wayes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In this whole Epiſtle the manifeſtation of mens intereſt in Chriſt is driven at, as a great end in the Apoſtles eye. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Theſe things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.</hi> Chap. 2. v. 3.12.20. Chap. 3. v. 1.10.19.24. <hi>Hereby we know that he abideth in us by his Spirit</hi> — Chap. 4.13. Chap. 5. v. 2.4. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Water and bloud doe witnes efficiently, that Chriſt is the Son of God: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6.8, 9, 10. Many in thoſe dayes denyed Chriſt to be the Son of God, and therein denyed that record which God gave of him, <hi>viz. That he hath given unto us eternall life, and this life is in his Son.</hi> v. 11.</p>
                     <p>In oppoſition to theſe Faith is deſcribed in this Chapter to be, a beleeving that Chriſt is the Son of God. Not, as if aſſenting to that, did expreſſe the whole nature of faith, but as it includeth a cordiall receiving of Chriſt,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119891:38"/>according to that record, <hi>v.</hi> 11. And hence, ſuch are ſaid to be <hi>borne of God,</hi> v. 1. and to overcome the world by their faith. <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. which argueth the whole of Juſtifying faith to be intended. Now, to eſtabliſh theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in theſe things. 1. That Chriſt is the Son of God, and therefore hath life to give, <hi>v.</hi> 1.11. 2. That they were borne of God, <hi>v.</hi> 1. had overcome the world, <hi>v.</hi> 5. and had eternall life in him, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13. Which latter falleth with the denyal of the former; no life to be had in Chriſt, if he be not the Son of God. To evidence and confirme the whole faith ſpoken of <hi>v.</hi> 1.5. he ſendeth them to ſix witnes, <hi>v</hi> 7, 8. whereof water and bloud are two. <hi>v.</hi> 6.8. As if he had ſaid, I appleale to your own experiences; have you not felt vertue and efficacy in the bloud of Chriſt for the pacification of your accuſing Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? and hath not Chriſt been as water. <hi>i.e.</hi> for the purification of your polluted ſoules? Theſe (ſaith the Apoſtle) are witneſſes that you are borne of God, and that Chriſt is the Son of God; for, none elſe hath power to do theſe things. But neither water nor bloud can witnes ſo much as, that Chriſt is the Son of God, to any ſoules, if themſelves be ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, unſeen, undiſcerned. I muſt know, I am Juſtified and ſanctified, in order before I can know Chriſt to be the Son of God thereby.</p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:119891:38"/>
                     <p>And the witneſſing of this efficiently is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Apoſtle. For 1. It is his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to ſtrengthen the beleevers (by theſe witneſſes) againſt that grand error of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt to be deſcended from God (which prevailed in thoſe times) and that cannot be accompliſhed by water and bloud without a diſcerning their teſtimonie. 2. Water and bloud witneſſed objectively before. 3. It is ſuch a witneſſing as is proper to beleevers, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. Whereas, Chriſt is objectively witneſſed to be the Son of God, unto unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevere. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.32, 33.36, 37, 38. <hi>Joh.</hi> 19 <hi>v.</hi> 34, 35.</p>
                     <p>And if I know that I have the water. <hi>i.e.</hi> Sanctification; and the bloud. <hi>i.e.</hi> Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then my Adoption is witneſſed effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to me alſo.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is expreſſely declared to be the end aimed at. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Theſe things have I written to you that beleeve</hi> — for what end? <hi>That [ye] may [know] that ye have eternall life</hi> — This was his ſcope or drift to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt unto them their title to eternall life. <hi>Ergo</hi> a witneſſing to particular ſoules their Adoption efficiently is intended, and that to all, even weake beleevers. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 2. From the extenſivenes of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21. Chriſt engageth to afford manifeſtations of himſelfe unto all that love
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119891:39"/>him, and the weakeſt beleever is a lover of Chriſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.14. <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with thoſe that feare him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant.</hi> Not eminent beleevers onely, but weake ones ſhall ſee his Covenant, for they feare him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Many that were weake in the faith, yet are concluded under a capacity to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the witneſſings of the Spirit, if not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an actual injoyment of them. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Know ye not that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. i.e.</hi> Can you be ignorant of it? if it be a doubting ſpeech whither they did know or not, yet it cannot but ſpeake a poſſibility of their knowing it. Nay, ſuch Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions frequently have the force of vehement Affirmations. <hi>i.e.</hi> ye doe know that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit dwelleth in you. And yet they were weak Chriſtians; <hi>for,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>I could not ſpeake unto you, as unto ſpiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto [babes in Chriſt].</hi> There is then, a poſſibility, even for babes in Chriſt, not onely to have a probable opinion, but a certaine knowledge, that the Spirit dwelleth in them; which is to know their Adoption. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 9. And, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Hereby [we] know he abideth in us, by the Spirit</hi> — And thoſe he writeth to, are little Children, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.12. He telleth them, <hi>that their ſins are forgiven them:</hi> which may aſſure us, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119891:39"/>it doth not make to the hurt of weake belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, to know they are forgiven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Weake Chriſtians ought to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe themſelves unto ſelfe-examination. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> They are in a capacitie to attaine a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their ſtate thereby. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your ſelves — Prove your ſelves</hi> — The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemination of the exhortation, argueth it to be a duty of high Concernment, elſe he would not uſe ſo much earneſtnes in exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it. And it is their ſtation they are to enquire about. 1. Whither they be in the faith. 2. Whither Chriſt be in them or not.</p>
                     <p>And, that weake beleevers are not exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from this duty is undenyable.</p>
                     <p>For 1. It extendeth or reacheth to unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers: thoſe that have not Chriſt in them, are to finde it out hereby: they are to try whither they be in the faith or no —</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It hath no limitation unto ſtrong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers: let them prove it, that will aſſert it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Theſe were weake in the faith, which are here twice over required to come up to it. 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21. <hi>Prone to envyings, ſtrifes, backbitings, whiſperings, ſwellings</hi> &amp;c. which are made the ſymptomes of but babes in Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. Yet, theſe are injoyned to examine, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome ſeaſons then, which all Chriſtians, even the weakeſt, ought to take
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119891:40"/>for ſelf-examination about their union with Chriſt. <hi>Ergo</hi> they are capable of doing it with good ſucceſſe.</p>
                     <p>Either weake Chriſtians muſt alwayes give in this verdict, that they are without Chriſt: and this is falſe, and the Lord doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to a falſe Concluſion. Or elſe, they muſt give in no verdict, and then the duty is fruitleſſe as to its proper end. Or elſe, they muſt conclude that they are in the faith. And the Text calleth for one of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions; Either 1. That they are in the faith. Or 2. Reprobates. <hi>i.e.</hi> unſound, hypocrites, without the Spirit. Unto all which I may adde, that theſe Romans, were many of them weake in the faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. &amp;c. And yet in the Text he excepteth and excludeth none, but ſeemeth to conclude all, under the witneſſings of the Spirit. By all which I cannot but apprehend, Aſſurance to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily attaineable, even by weake belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>

                     <p>

                     <p>Before I give a direct anſwer to this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, I ſhall premiſe, that the anſwers to it, will be uſefull, to ſuch ends as theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To give ſatisfaction unto doubting ſoules: many precious ſons of <hi>Sion</hi> are full of feares about their Adoption: could they but know that God were their Father, they ſhould account it a favour of great value. Whereas, the Spirit hath witneſſed this to them, but they know not its voyce, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not, that theſe operations which they have found, doe amount to a teſtimonie of Divine love. They queſtion, whither they be from the Spirit or not; or elſe, whither they be witneſſing, and intended by the Lord for that end. By a due obſervation of what I ſhall here lay downe, and the ſhinings of the Spirit on its owne workes, (without which nothing will be witneſſing) thoſe, that never
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119891:41"/>had Aſſurance, way attaine it, and thoſe that have loſt it, may recover it againe; if by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion they can finde that ſuch workes have paſſed upon their hearts, as I ſhall ſpeake of.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To difference the teſtimonie of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from Deluſions of Satan, and the ſingle teſtimonie of our owne Spirit: that ſo the voyce of the Spirit may be owned, and Sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall deluſions rejected.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To confirme and eſtabliſh thoſe that doe injoy witneſſings, in the perſwaſion of their Adoption.</p>
                     <p>And, the better to attaine theſe ends, I ſhall,
<list>
                           <item>1 Speake particularly unto the feverall wayes of witneſſing. How a ſoule may know that. 1. The Spirit. 2. Water. 3. Bloud have witneſſed.</item>
                           <item>2. Adde ſome Generall diſcoveries, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary evidences which will reſpect all thoſe wayes of witneſſing.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>According unto the threefold way of the Spirits witneſſing, ſo muſt I divide the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion into three.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu:</hi> 1. How may a ſoule know whither the Spirit hath witneſſed its Adoption to it, in that more Immediate way, or not?</p>
                     <p>Before I reply to this Queſtion, I ſhall give theſe pre-conſiderations.</p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:119891:41"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Preconſid.</hi> 1. That there muſt be ſome great and remarkeable impreſſion and alteration made upon the heart, working it into ſome ſtrong perſwaſion of Adoption; elſe there is not the leaſt ground for a pretending to an Immediate teſtimony. Thoſe that never found any thing of this nature, are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this Queſtion; for, there muſt be ſomething like the teſtimonie, to make ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of tryal. The Nature of an Immediate preſence of the Spirit, and the application of a word, require, that there be ſome great impreſſion when ever they be injoyed. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.21. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. 2 <hi>Corin</hi> 3.3. So that, if a man ſhould read over witneſſing words never ſo often, and his thoughts ſhould run this way, that God is his God, and Chriſt and eternall life his; yet, if no power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth alongſt with the word, to fix, faſten, and ſet it upon the heart; there is not any colour for an Immediate teſtimonie. The word muſt take deep rooting in the heart. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 21.23. elſe, no gracious effects at all, are accompliſhed by it; much leſſe can it be witneſſing. But if a man hath found ſome great alteration made upon his Spirit, that hath wrought towards a perſwaſion of Adoption. Our enquiry is, How he may know whither it be meerly a ſtrong flaſhy opinion and fancy of his owne Spirit, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119891:42"/>of Satan, or indeed a teſtimonie from the Divine Spirit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Preconſ.</hi> 2. That my deſigne in anſwering this Queſtion, is not to diſcover, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in Chriſt and who not (that will be the thing driven at, when I come to ſpeake of the Spirits witneſſing by water &amp; bloud) But, if a man hath a teſtimonie of intereſt in Chriſt by ſome eminent impreſſion made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Spirit; our enquiry is, whither it be from the Divine Spirit, or be a Deluſion. I ſuppoſe, that many reall beleevers, may (through their owne default) want this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate teſtimonie of the Spirit, and may be under falſe confidences, through the Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Satan, <hi>i. e.</hi> Confidences taken up, from ſuch grounds as are not evidencing. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.6. when by a due ſearch, they might finde infallible grounds, for the ſame Concluſions. This Queſtion is not for the tryal of Chriſtianitie, but of ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Preconſ.</hi> 3. That the primary evidence of this Immediate teſtimonie, is not to be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or reſtrained, unto this Immediate way of witneſſing onely: For, as graces doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſcover their owne proceeding to be from the Spirit: ſo, at other times the Spirit evidenceth its owne preſence in the exerciſe of graces. Indeed, it is the very buſines of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119891:42"/>Spirit, and the maine errand it is ſent upon, to put the ſoule into a perſwaſion of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when it witneſſeth in this Immediate way, and ſo the ſoules aſſurance of the truth of the thing teſtified, hath a great depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance here, on its knowledge that the Spirit is the witnes, and therefore uſually, it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the moſt tranſparent, and remarkable tokens of of its owne preſence here. Yet, it is not to be confined to that way of witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: but ſometimes, the Spirit draweth out graces to act at ſuch a height, more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and doth ſo efficaciouſly witnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, by reflex acts upon theſe; as, it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſufficient evidence to its owne preſence therein.</p>

                     <p>I Shall now anſwer the Queſtion by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. What doth primarily.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What doth ſecondarily evidence the truth of ſuch a teſtimonie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ:</hi> 1. The Spirit it ſelfe doth primarily evidence, the proceeding of its owne wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119891:43"/>acts from it ſelfe, whil'ſt a ſoule is in an actual injoyment of them: thoſe irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and other Concurrences of the Spirit, doe carry with them ſuch cleare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing demonſtrations to the ſoule, of their coming from the Spirit, as render it in ſome meaſure perſwaded thereof. There are ſuch ſparklings of Divinity in them, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious name of the bleſſed Spirit, is in ſuch a lively way engraven, or enſtamped upon them, as, they doe aloude proclaime them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have their original from that holy Spirit. According to that degree of clearnes which the Spirit manifeſteth its owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in; ſo, is the degree of perſwaſion in the ſoule ſtronger or weaker. And when there is a Plerophorie, or full Aſſurance, all other things would be but as a candle lighted up to ſee the Sun by, which is beſt ſeen by its owne light: and ſo is the Spirit beſt ſeen in the ſoule by its owne light, and all other things are but additional confirmations, and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary evidences hereof. If the Spirit hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed witneſſed to a ſoule its Adoption here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and now its teſtimonie be clouded or eclipſed; by a ſerious reviewing the forgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teſtimonie, and judicious reflexions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that; uſually, it will more eaſily recover it againe, then by any extrinſecall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations or conſequential effects whatever:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119891:43"/>for, the appearances of the Spirit are moſt conſpicuous in its witneſſing acts, which are intended purpoſely to aſſure; yet, effects are very uſefull for confirmation.</p>
                     <p>Now, that the Spirit doth afford mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of it ſelfe, in its owne teſtimonie: or, that it doth operate ſo efficaciouſly as is doth evidence its owne preſence in its wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing acts, and giveth the ſoule (that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth them) a knowledge of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it ſelfe, and that they can be from no other, I ſhall prove by theſe following Arguments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. From his appointment unto this witneſſing worke: were not Adoption a thing queſtionable and controverſiall in the ſoule, there needed no calling in of witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The very uſe of them is,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.21</note> the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eſtabliſhment of a matter againſt Contradiction, ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1. And, it is the ſpecial reaſon why the Spirit (rather then any other) is ordained as the witnes, becauſe that is [truth] 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6.</p>
                     <p>If I queſtion the faithfulnes of a witnes, the teſtimonie is never certaine to me: and ſo, the Spirit who is truth it ſelfe, is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted as the witnes, that we might be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly aſcertained of what is ſpoken upon the credit of the Witnes or Revealer; and hence, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>The teſtimonie of God is greater</hi> — which
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119891:44"/>imports that the great inducement to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the teſtimonie, or owne and confide in it, is this, the greatnes, faithfulnes, and truth of him which beareth record; it is God, who is greater then men, and therefore more to be credited.</p>
                     <p>And, this can be no enforcement unto my reception of the teſtimonie, if the Spirit doth not evidence it ſelfe to be the author of it, whoſe truth is to be my incentive to recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it. The maine thing towards aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance would be wanting (which is the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of him that ſpeaketh) if the Spirit ſhould not evidence its owne preſence in teſtifying. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelfe witneſſeth &amp;c.</hi> Here, the Holy-Ghoſt as well directeth us to looke for its preſence in witneſſing, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth that it is its office, to beare witnes. And, how little it ſhould contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards efficacious witneſſing, if it did not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it ſelfe, in its operations, you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fily conceive, by conſidering theſe things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That it is uſuall for Satan to bring in contradictory teſtimonies, to thoſe of the Spirit: and ſo the ſoule is in a Labyrinth of trouble and perplexitie, not knowing which to owne or chooſe. A conſcientious ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction muſt ariſe from aſſurance that the witnes is faithful. If my owne Spirit and Satan ſhould joyne together in one teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119891:44"/>of my adoption, it were invalid; becauſe the witneſſes are unfaithful. Satan can aſſert, and give impulſions to receive his record: therefore, if the Spirit did not evidence its owne preſence in its teſtimonie, againſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans deluding voyce, the ſoule would be no nearer ſatisfaction about its ſtate, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit witneſſed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Then, the Spirit ſhould anſwer one doubt with another: for, the uncertaintie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the witnes, may create as much diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, as any thing elſe; yea, it raiſeth a new ground of perplexitie.</p>
                     <p>O (ſaith the ſoule) I feared my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on formerly, and here is a teſtimonie, but whence it cometh I know not. I doubt as much of that, as I did before of my Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and O if it ſhould be from Satan and I ſhould owne it, my condition would be yet worſe then before. And if it muſt ſeeke for other demonſtrations whither it be from the Spirit or no, it is in as much darknes as ever: and then it did nothing to wards the end it is ſent to attaine, for the matter remaineth as dubious as formerly, and the ſoule no nearer ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. The Spirit is the higheſt Witnes. <hi>Ergo,</hi> It evidenceth the truth of its owne te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie, or its owne preſence in it.</p>
                     <p>There muſt be ſomething to give a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119891:45"/>that the teſtimonie cometh from the Spirit: and there can be none higher then the Spirit to give it.</p>
                     <p>For. 1. It is the Spirit that maketh other things witneſſing: therefore that is the chiefe witnes. No graces or experiences can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes without him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is called [the Witnes] 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 6. 10. And if any inferiour witnes can evidence it ſelfe, or the Spirit; that being the higheſt witnes may evidence it ſelfe much more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. From its ſpecial appointment for this very end, to give manifeſtations unto the Saints of what they ſhould know: this is a maine uſe which the Spirit is intended for. 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11, 12. But God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them to us by his Spirit. <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe things, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>that eye hath not ſeen</hi> — and <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>we have received the Spirit;</hi> for what end? <hi>[That we might know the things that are freely given us of God]</hi> Whereas, if the Spirit did not give demonſtrations of its owne preſence in its revelations, the ſoule might queſtion whither the things diſcovered, were from God or not: and ſo the Revelations would be of little uſe or advantage, and could not ſway the will to a rejection of what it hath formerly owned, contrary to what is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent revealed.</p>
                     <p>And, what light can have more perſpicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119891:45"/>and clearnes in it, for the manifeſtation of Satanicall illuſions, then the light which proceedeth from the Spirit, whoſe office it is to diſcover or manifeſt what is unknowne? And I am perſwaded, that when the Spirit cometh in à witneſſing way, its light is like a candle, or rather a beame of the Sun, dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the ſoule; whereby it ſeeth into the cunning inſinuations, unjuſt accuſations, violent and horrid temptations, and curſed deluſions of Satan, more then at other times: and knoweth them to have their riſte from him.</p>
                     <p>The annointing of the Spirit, which is within the Saints, is ſaid to <hi>teach them all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.27. and to helpe againſt thoſe Seducers, <hi>v.</hi> 26.. <hi>i.e.</hi> by the word as a means, it manifeſteth what is conſentaneous or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the minde of Chriſt: and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth therein, againſt all thoſe craftie ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtications, whereby Satan ſeduceth many: &amp; the ſame Spirit taketh off the vailes which are upon the hearts of men, and giveth them open viſions of Divine glory. 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, 18.</p>
                     <p>All which ſpeake out thus much, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations from the Spirit, by the Word, have an inbred propertie to evidence their owne proceeding from the Spirit, and to diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate or difference themſelves from thoſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119891:46"/>flaſhes of Satan whereby he ſtriveth to his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, to lead ſoules into groundles Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, about matters of the higheſt moment; elſe, they would not be effectual to prevent ſeduction,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.26.</note> which is one ſpecial end, they are ordained to. That which convincingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth a deluſion of Satan, muſt evidence it ſelfe to come from God. Deluſions may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Word, but the annointing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, teacheth the Saints, what is indeed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Word.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. From the Lords ordaining the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being, or in-dwelling of the Spirit to be an evidence of our Adoption: if it ſelfe were inevident it could not conduce unto that end: for, every reaſon from whence any Concluſion is collected, muſt be clearer then the Concluſion it ſelfe: onely light can ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.13. That which evidenceth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to me, muſt needs it ſelfe be more diſcernable. It were impoſſible for a man ſucceſſully to try his ſtate by the inhabitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit, if that were not more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſeſt then his ſtate. And indeed what can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence its indwelling, but it ſelfe?</p>
                     <p>Now, this is often made the Rule for try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; as, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Ye are not in the fleſh, but in the Spirit:</hi> Now how ſhall we know that? <hi>[If the Spirit of God dwelleth in you]</hi> and it is added <hi>[He that hath not the Spirit is none of his].</hi>

By all which it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that the Spirit doth give teſt monie to it ſelfe, in ſome of its operations, or evidence that neither Satan, nor any Creature can be the author of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But the Spirit is not diſcearnable in its eſſence, but in its operations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ:</hi> 1. The application of promiſes is a ſpecial worke of the Spirit, wherein its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is as diſcernable, as in any other of its operations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. Thoſe which are the witneſſing acts of the Spirit, have the greateſt aptitude to afford ſoule-ſatisfying manifeſtations of the Spirits preſence in themſelves, of all other: for, the intention of the Lord in them is, to manifeſt adoption to the ſoule, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. And, ſeing a knowledge of its preſence in the acts is a maine requiſite unto Aſſurance by them; hence, they cannot fall ſhort of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering that.</p>
                     <p>Theſe operations have more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light, life and ſtrength in them; they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in their brightnes from other concurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit, as much as the cleareſt Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiny day, doth from that which is moſt dark and cloudy: and therefore if ever the Spirit
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119891:47"/>be ſeen in any operations, it is in theſe which are the brighteſt beames of this Sun. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by a ſecret touch irreſiſtibly ſtriketh the ſoule into ſuch cleare, firme, and ſtrong ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and perſwaſions of its adoption, that though it meeteth with much within and with ut; from Satan, its owne heart, and Chriſtian friends, to worke it into a contrary perſwaſion; yet, it cannot but ſay, as, <hi>Job</hi> 19.25. <hi>I know</hi> — or, as, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38. <hi>I am perſwaded</hi> — As, the Spirit giveth effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Convictions of ſin that the ſoule cannot deny its guiltines, which formerly hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted its innocency; and that without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring whither the Spirit hath done this or not: So, it doth worke effectually into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of Adoption, that till afterward, it doth not, cannot, or need not reflect to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whither it were the Spirit or no. And ſo the eſſence of the Spirit may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneable, and yet the teſtimonie may be ſure to the ſoule: by operations it may conclude the preſence of the Spirit. Yea, the Spirit doth not onely give ſuch a perſwaſion, but alſo it diſcovereth ſome invincible grounds, and giveth ſuch undenyable demonſtrations, both of its owne preſence, and of the reality of what is ſpoken, that as one under power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Convictions thereof, it cannot but fall downe before it, and ſay to the Spirit, as they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119891:47"/>did to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 29, 30. <hi>Now thou ſpeakeſt plainly, and ſpeakeſt no proverb, by this I beleeve that thou comeſt forth from God.</hi> As, from ſome Divine Attributes, that ſhine forth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently in thoſe witneſſing acts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Spirit cauſeth the ſoule to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Divine wiſdome in the application of promiſes: as, in the ſeaſon of their coming in, and ſutablenes unto its preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in the manner of their working; it findeth how Satan was defeated in his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes thereby; his methods and ſnares diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and he confounded, and then the ſoule cannot but cry out, as, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 33. <hi>O the depth of the riches of Gods wiſdome</hi> —</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Spirit giveth it to ſee Divine power improved for it in a glorious way: and hence <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 18, 19, 20. He beggeth the enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenings of the Spirit for them, <hi>that they might know,</hi> v. 19. <hi>what is the exceeding greatnes of his power to them-ward who beleeve &amp;c.</hi> The Saints often feele a Divine power in the application of promiſes—but they cannot tell who is the agent, whither Satan or the Spirit; and ſo the Apoſtle asketh that they might have a diſtinct knowledge hereof: which argueth, that the Spirit diſcovereth that there is an improvement of its owne power (and ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnceth its owne preſence) in ſome of its actings; eſpecially in giving a knowledge
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119891:48"/>of the hope of calling, as, <hi>v.</hi> 18. And the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit convinceth hereof, by the exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the power which is put forth. 1. It overcometh the heart into an acceptation of the promiſe: the ſoule ſeeth its owne utter inſufficiency in it ſelfe, to make ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of a promiſe, as now it hath felt; and an utter averſnes, and reall backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thereunto, though there had been abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. It was ready with <hi>Sarah</hi> to laugh at the newes of the promiſe, or to ſay with thoſe, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.2. <hi>If the Lord ſhould make windowes in heaven, it could not be accompliſhed to me:</hi> and yet it was not able to withſtand the power that did draw it that way. 2. It overcometh Satan: the Spirit diſcovereth how Satan rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his utmoſt oppoſition againſt the cloſure with the promiſe, and many temptations are brought to freſh remembrance, whereby he ſought to keep it at the greateſt diſtance from it: yea it ſeeth the ſame power that draweth to the promiſe, laid out to the utmoſt againſt Satan therein. And from hence (ſaith the Spirit) it could not be thy ſelfe or Satan, for both run croſſe to it, and therefore it muſt needs be the Divine Spirit that hath done this.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Spirit convinceth it of Chriſts faithfulnes herein: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2.5.8. <hi>I will make knowne thy faithfulnes to all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119891:48"/>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Who is a ſtrong Lord like unto thee? or to thy faithfulnes round about thee?</hi> So, a ſoule after ſuch a teſtimonie is exceedingly taken up with the faithfuines of the Lord, that it ſpeaketh to God after this manner. Thou didſt formerly enable me to a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on thy ſelfe in this promiſe, and when my heart flagged, fainted, failled, and gave over all hopes of it, yet now haſt thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed it, and throwne the mercy into my lap, and diſcovered thy faithfulnes when I was unfaithful.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Spirit convinceth it of Divine goodnes, in the application of the promiſe: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>O how great is thy goodnes</hi>—his ſoule is even ſwallowed up with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the extenſivenes of it <hi>[O how great—]</hi> &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord that hath ſhewed me marvellous kindnes</hi>-What maketh him ſo much wonder at Divine goodnes? <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>I ſaid in my haſt I am cut off—Nevertheleſſe, thou heardeſt</hi>—So, the Spirit cauſeth a ſoule to ſee, how full of diſtruſt that hath been, how ready to ſay that it was neglected of God, and how, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, the Lord dealt thus and thus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly with it, and it cannot but cry out, <hi>O how great is thy goodnes!</hi> it is even wrapped up as into the third heaven, and ſo taken up with redeeming love in the application of ſome promiſe, as for the time, nothing can
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:119891:49"/>put it upon a denyal, of the working of this love towards it.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have ſhewne what is the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evidence.</p>
                     <p>By all that hath been ſaid, it may ſeeme that this Queſtion [How a ſoule may know this Teſtimonie?] is needleſſe for ſuch as are actually under it; ſeing the very worke of the Spirit is, to give a knowledge of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But in regard.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Afterward the Spirit may ſuſpend its operations, and then the ſoule may queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Some have ſtrong Conceits and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they injoy this more Immediate te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie, of the Spirit, when they are meerly under deluſions: and this firſt anſwer, though it holdeth out the primary evidence of it, unto thoſe that really injoy it, yet it may ſeeme not to reach ſo farre as to diſcover who have it not.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

Hence, (though I ſuppoſe ſuch ſignes are ceaſed) yet, it not being inconſiſtent with the nature of an Immediate teſtimonie, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert ſome inferiour evidences of it: and ſeing the Spirit doth accompliſh ſome ſpiritual works in the ſoules of Saints, in and by its
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119891:49"/>witneſſing acts, which may ſupply the place of thoſe extraordinary ſignes, therefore I ſhall ſpeake further.</p>

                        <hi>Anſ:</hi> 2. THe Secondary Evidence of the more Immediate Teſtimonie is Faith: there are ſome eminent acts of faith drawne out by it; but Deluſions of Satan or the ſingle teſtimonie of our Spirit, leane without theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Faith is exerciſed upon Chriſt in that witneſſing word which is applyed: that, look how it is to act upon any other word, in the ſame way and manner it doth upon this. The Spirit applyeth the promiſe, but faith, receiveth it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>In full aſſurance of faith</hi> — if a ſoule hath attained full aſſurance, faith hath a hand in it, or it is brought in by beleeving: and therefore faith is called <hi>the evidence of things not ſeen. Heb.</hi> 11.1. There are varietie of examples in that Chapter, of faith's acting upon various occaſions. Now, if ſuch acts be drawne out upon witneſſing words, as carry a correſpondency with them, unto thoſe in <hi>Ahel, Abraham, Moſes,</hi> &amp;c. upon
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119891:50"/>other or ſuch words, then they are Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive or witneſſing. And a reflexion upon thoſe acts of faith muſt needs be very uſefull and conducible towards the diſcovering a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie to be from the Spirit. A reviewing of an Evidence is enough to decide the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Faith is exerciſed upon Chriſt in other promiſes, beſides that which is witneſſing: whil'ſt the ſoule was full of feares and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionings about its intereſt in adopting love, it acted faith very little in compariſon of what now it doth. Whatſoever the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing word giveth it aſſurance of, faith now liveth upon Chriſt in the promiſe for it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith. Pſal.</hi> 25.2. <hi>O my God, I truſt in thee. Pſal</hi> 63. <hi>v.</hi> 1.8. When a ſoule hath a ſight of propriety in God, this putteth it upon redoubled actings of ſaith. If it can ſay [my God] it cannot but ſay [I truſt in thee]. Deluſions ſet not faith upon the wing for the mercies that it ſuppoſeth it ſelfe to have intereſt in. Nay, they doe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the actings of it. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.17, 18.20. She neglected making out to Chriſt for all, yea ſhut the doore of her ſoule againſt him, that Chriſt ſtands without knocking, and cannot have admittance ſo long as the voyce of her owne Spirit was attended to.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 1. But when is a word or promiſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119891:50"/>received by faith? and ſo, when doth faith evidence a teſtimonie to be no Deluſion?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. When the heart is commanded into a perſwaſion of Adoption by the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing word, as an act of obedience to the Lord: not barely when there is a giving in of a word (as I ſhall ſhew in another place) but when the Spirit overaweth the ſoule, with the Majeſtie that cometh alongſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, to yeild ſubjection to it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.8. <hi>The Lord will command his loving kindnes</hi> — he not onely offereth it to the ſoule, and leaves it to freedome whither it will own it or not, but he exerciſeth his Soveraignty, and uſeth a Commanding voyce, that his loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes muſt viſit it; and that in a ſenſible way, for, he addeth [<hi>his Song ſhall be with me</hi> —] <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>He hath ſent redemption to his people, he hath Commanded his Covenant</hi> — as when he cometh with a word of Conviction he commandeth ſtout-hearted ones to a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; ſo, he commandeth his Covenant,. <hi>i.e.</hi> his promiſes, unto his people, by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to owne him therein. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.3. <hi>He commanded bleſſing</hi>—Thus the Spirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth aſſurance into the Saints by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and commandeth faith to owne his loving kindneſſes; and ſo, not barely a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that this promiſe or that mercy is mine, doth make the act of faith evidencing,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:119891:51"/>but that Divine authoritie, that attended the word to the heart, and cauſed it to give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit thereunto, out of reſpect and reverence to the Lord the Speaker. Not every one that hath a perſwaſion that Chriſt is his, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the witneſſings of the Spirit: for <hi>Baalim</hi> ſaid, <hi>My God, Numb.</hi> 22.18. and yet had not intereſt in God, as his God: and they <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. ſhall be conſident of their intereſt in Chriſt, and yet ſhall be found without it.</p>
                     <p>Satan doth raiſe ſuch falſe confidences in many prophane wretches, and backeth them with ſome Scriptures; as, <hi>that God willeth not the death of a ſinner, and Chriſt came to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> &amp;c. and their owne Spirits conclude, that they are the ſinners he came to ſave. But unleſſe ſuch words have commanded the heart into ſuch a perſwaſion out of reſpect to the Lord, they are not evidencing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When thoſe undoubtedly ſinfull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, that ſwarmed in the ſoule before, are ſuppreſſed by the reception of the word: unbeliefe is the great ſin, yet ſoules are more unapt to be ſenſible of, and affected with that, then with other ſins. But, if the Spirit hath acted faith upon Chriſt in any promiſe, then it is pained and afflicted with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of its former miſtruſtfulnes, and riſeth up in oppoſition againſt it, as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>v.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Why art thou caſt downe O my ſoule, why
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119891:51"/>art thou diſquieted within me? hope in God</hi> — Before it gave way to, and fed the carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings of its owne Spirit, againſt the free promiſe of God: but, now it calls off its heart from theſe, and calleth it up to truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God.</p>
                     <p>Faith is called an Evidence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. it is a Logical terme, importing a Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by way of diſpute, As reaſon doth by premiſes draw up certain Concluſions about matters within its Sphaere; ſo, faith, doth ſomething anſwerable, (though the things it is converſant about, be out of the reach of ſenſe and reaſon) that doth in able the ſoule by ſcriptural principles and grounds to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute downe cavils and carnal reaſonings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the free promiſe, and thus it is an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Deluſions doe ſtupifie men, that they ſeeke not for a ſatisfactory deliverance from objections: but, the Spirit like the Sun cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſuch miſts of darknes to flee away, and putteth enough into the mouth to anſwer Satan in all.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When its reception of the word or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe cauſeth ſelfe-abaſement: <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.27. The woman was ſo deeply ſenſible of her unworthines, that ſhe acknowledgeth her ſelfe to be a dog, and then preſently Chriſt owneth her faith, <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>O woman great is thy faith.</hi> Great faith cauſeth great ſelfe-abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119891:52"/>When all matter of diſcouragement that is throwne in the ſoules way to its mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, tendeth to the making it ſenſible of its owne nothingnes, and yet cauſeth it to lay faſter hold of the promiſe; and when the ſtronger its aſſurance of the mercy be, the greater ſelfe-annihilation and the leſſe ſelfe-confidence, then faith is acting, and Chriſt taketh notice of, and ſetteth a Character of reſpect upon ſuch acts of faith.</p>
                     <p>But that which cauſeth ſelfe-advancement is the voyce of thy owne Spirit, or a deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Satan. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.31. <hi>Peter</hi> was carried out with vehemency of affection and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Chriſt; he declared his preferring Chriſt before his owne life, and yet this was but the voyce of his owne Spirit, becauſe it did ſpring from ſelfe-confidence, which is oppoſite unto faith.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When the heart is carryed out Chriſt-ward by the reception of any promiſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving is often called <hi>a coming to Chriſt,</hi> as, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 35.37. And on the other ſide, ſoule departures from God, are reſolved into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleife. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. when there is, not onely a perſwaſion wrought by the promiſe, that Chriſt is mine &amp;c. but, the whole heart run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth out after Chriſt upon the application of it. If it taketh the promiſe as from his hand. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.6. and owneth him in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119891:52"/>of the mercies it is aſſured of, &amp; builds its confidence upon him for the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, and is layd under ſtrong obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations &amp; engagements to Chriſt for them, it cryeth out, <hi>What ſhall I render to him? Pſal.</hi> 116.12. accounting nothing too deare for him, and maketh improvement of them by and for Chriſt, then the word is from Chriſt. So, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt?</hi> i.e. from that love wherewith we love Chriſt; and thence he addeth; <hi>Shall tribulations, or diſtreſſe, or perſecution or famine</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> None of theſe hardſhips, ſhall breake off our love to him. <hi>v.</hi> 36. <hi>As it is written, for thy ſake we are killed all the day long</hi> — And when was their love to Chriſt ſo ſtrong? <hi>v.</hi> 33.38, 39. It was when their perſwaſion was as ſtrong of the love of God in Chriſt to them. And now they oppoſe Chriſt without them, againſt all charges. <hi>v.</hi> 33. and not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion within themſelves: yet, that perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was uſefull that way, not abſtractively from Chriſt, but as it was a furtherance to their heartie owning of him. Faith maketh uſe of ſuch a generall, as that Chriſt dyed, againſt all charges, that are brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a particular ſoule.</p>
                     <p>You may have ſuch ſtrong confidences of your intereſt in the love of God in Chriſt, as no arguments a man can uſe, can beate
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119891:53"/>you off from theſe, and yet you may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, if your hearts be not anſwerably drawne out after Chriſt, to the ſtrength of your confidences. But if they be built and botromed upon him, and his free favour in the free promiſes, as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.7. And if your affection to Chriſt riſe as high, and be as ſtrong as your perſwaſion of his love, then you have injoyed the witneſſings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
                     <p>And thus, there are many things in that faith which receiveth witneſſing words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the perſwaſion of the thing witneſſed, which may difference a teſtimony of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in this more Immediate way, from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion of Satan, or our owne Spirits.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But may I not be very liable to be deceived about ſuch acts of faith, ſeing no Scripture, either expreſſely, or by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſaith of any particular man, that he is united to Chriſt, Adopted, Juſtified, &amp;c? Surely a certainty of faith cannot be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of this, becauſe it is unwritten.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſoule may have a certainty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this as well as other acts of faith, if it be in a fit capacitie to judge of any, and duely conſidereth all requiſites unto the ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of an act of faith, and all the ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents or concurring acts of the Spirit in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of ſuch a promiſe. And the better to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119891:53"/>evince this and anſwer the objection, I ſhall lay downe three things, which will much conduce to cleare this Coaſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The act of faith may be a clearer evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of its being of the right ſtampe, then the object: a man may have a right object for his faith, &amp; yet not having a right act about that object, his faith can witnes nothing: thus, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Many beleeved [in Chriſts Name]</hi> Here was the right object of faith, as you may ſee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. and yet their faith is vaine, <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25. and no evidence. So, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.30, 31. They beleeved on Chriſt, and yet they had not God but the Devil for their Father. <hi>v.</hi> 34, 39.44. So <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 13. Yea, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19. <hi>The Devils beleeve that there is one God and tremble</hi> — and the Apoſtle declareth this purpoſely to prove the defectivenes of faith, though it may have a Scriptural ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                     <p>A man may put forth but a natural act, about a ſupernatural object; may have but a humane faith about Divine things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.5. There is more required unto the ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of true faith, then this, that there be a crediting or aſſenting to what is written.</p>
                     <p>Now, if the Nature or Quality of the act of faith, be conſiderable and muſt be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, before Son-ſhip can be concluded from it; then, ſeing thoſe differencing things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119891:54"/>the act, are to be found in that faith which is drawne out in the application of witneſſing words; hence a man is no more liable to be deceived in this, then in other acts of faith.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Scriptures declare ſuch as doe rightly beleeve to be adopted and juſtified, and determineth what faith is. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.39. <hi>By him all that beleeve are juſtified</hi> —</p>
                     <p>And the giving ſuch a Characteriſticall note, muſt needs be a particularizing of them, as well as if the Lord ſhould call them by name, and ſay thou <hi>John, Thomas</hi> — thou art juſtified or Adopted. If Legacies be given though their names which they are given to, be not expreſſely mentioned in the Will, yet a diſtinguiſhing Character is equivalent to a naming of them: ſo, faith is made a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Adopted ones, and ſo it is written and by good Conſequence it may be concluded from the Word who are adopted.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The ſupervenient act of the Spirit in the effectual application of a word is enough to particularize it unto the ſoule, and then the Word it ſelfe is witneſſing: it is no where written in Scripture in expreſſe termes, that <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin</hi> ſhall be raiſed up at the laſt day; yet ſeing the generall words about the reſurrection, doe include all particulars un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119891:54"/>them: hence, it is not improper to ſay it is written, that they ſhall riſe againe: but, though the Scripture ſaith it, yet, it was the Spirits application of thoſe generall words that cauſed them to beleeve their owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
                     <p>It is no where written that this or that perſon ſhall beleeve, or that he ſhall have convictions, or ſupportments &amp;c. by this or that Sermon; or, that this Scripture ſhall be uſefull to theſe ends to one ſoule, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture for the ſame ends to another &amp;c. but there are ſome ſpecial operations of the Spirit neceſſary, and hereby a generall Call is made particular, and ſo this ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth on Chriſt, when many that heare the ſame Sermon and by the written word had a Call as well as he, yet beleeve not.</p>
                     <p>And, hence, many Scriptures are preſſed that have a direct tendency to worke a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction upon a man, and prevaile not; but as laſt one word is ſingled out and worketh mightily that way. At the ſame word, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. ſome mocked, <hi>v.</hi> 32. others beleeved, <hi>v.</hi> 34. &amp; hence many words ſutable to a ſoules condition may be viewed and yet are not ſuccouring, and at laſt one culled out from reſt affordeth much releife to it.</p>
                     <p>All which, doe abundantly evidence that the operation of the Spirit is ſufficient to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:119891:55"/>particularize a word to a ſoule, and that the Spirit is ordinarily afforded for ſuch ends. No ſoule is converted, but there is ſuch an appropriating of Goſpell invitations to it. And the like Concurrences of the Spirit with ſome words, will make them witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, which make thoſe convincing, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſupporting &amp;c. and the teſtimonie will be as ſcriptural as any of thoſe other works, which are frequently wrought by the Spirit as all grant. And ſeing in thoſe teſtifying acts by a word, the Spirit operateth as effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, and uſually in a more eminent way then at other times; hence, they are as viſible and acts of faith here, as evident as about o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words.</p>
                     <p>All which being laid together I cannot but reckon the aſſurance of ſalvation to be a certainty of faith. The Concluſion being drawne from Scripture both directly and by Conſequence. Though the word alone doth not witneſſe, yet by the Spirits application of it to the ſoule it doth, and that muſt be by faith. Indeed the Spirit properly could not be ſaid to witneſſe that [we] are the Sons of God, nor hardly were a witnes at all if the teſtimonie were not a certainty of faith, and to be received upon the credit of the revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, ſo as if it came from another, as Satan &amp;c. it were not to be owned. And hence,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119891:55"/>1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16. <hi>We have [knowne] and [beleeved] the love that God hath to us.</hi> And it is a hainous ſin not to give credit to it, and that becauſe the Spirit is the witnes. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.9.</p>
                     <p>And, heaven or Eternal life is abſolutely promiſed unto all beleevers. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.15. <hi>That by the meanes of his death — they which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led might receive the promiſe of eternall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Jam.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15. That faith and hope are to act upon theſe, as well as other words, is undenyable: what uſe elſe doe they ſerve to? and how elſe can thoſe that are called receive them? ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 18.22.29. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Let us put on for an helmet the hope of ſalvation. Titus</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>In hope of eternall life, which God that cannot lie promiſed</hi>—whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this faith and hope be raiſed by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent particular application of the promiſe; or by a reflexion upon foregoing acts of faith; either way they muſt be Divine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe built and bottomed upon the promiſe of God, who cannot lie. And if the latter way, that ſtrongly proveth that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veening of reflex acts, cannot hinder aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from being a certainty of Divine faith.</p>
                     <p>I might give other ſecondary evidences of this immediate teſtimonie: as, the ſoule is enabled to diſcerne many of its former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences at ſuch a time, and many gracious
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:119891:56"/>effects are produced by it &amp;c. but theſe are more fully opened elſe-where, eſpecially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the generall evidences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But many have had flaſhes of joy, in the reception of the word, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.13. yea, have been raiſed unto a high degree of hope, and even a triumphing joy, who yet have been hypocrites, <hi>Job</hi> 8.13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 27.8. <hi>Job</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 5. and others have been made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Holy-Ghoſt, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, &amp; the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, and yet have been under deluſions all this while. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5, 6. How ſhall I diſcerne that I goe beyond theſe?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are many things already hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that will difference the teſtimonie of the Spirit, from ſuch ſlaſhes as theſe are: but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The witneſſings of the Spirit cauſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tranſſormations into the image of the word; deluſions or common workes of the Spirit leave without theſe. A man may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Holy-Ghoſt, in the gifts of it, as <hi>Saul</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.10. and yet no imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word in the heart. Some one affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as joy may ariſe upon the reception of the word, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20, 21. and yet the word have no root, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.6. the heart not be changed into the nature of it: but when
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119891:56"/>the Spirit worketh effectually by a word, then there is a counterpane of the word in the heart, and hence, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.10. The Lord doth promiſe in the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to write his word in their hearts: ſome principles and diſpoſitions or inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are wrought within, that have a lively reſemblance in them unto the word, 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 3.3.18. <hi>We — beholding as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Saith Mr <hi>Forbes,</hi> the working of the Spirit in the wicked is like the ſmell of an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caris Shop: which one that paſſeth by, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, although he never carry any of theſe odoriferous things with him. But, the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing of the Spirit to the Elect is by impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the thing witneſſed to the ſoule, and making it really to poſſeſſe it. So that if a man could ſee the ſoule of a true childe of God, he ſhould ſee engraven in it, mercy, peace, love, righteouſneſſe, life, joy, and Chriſt himſelfe. All the promiſes of God in Chriſt, being written therein according to the Covenant of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The witneſſings of the Spirit, have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull operations in the heart towards the attainment of ſpirituall, Goſpell ends there: The end any worke driveth at, is a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:119891:57"/>what it is, if a man be not lightly, but effectually carried out after it. The noiſe of heaven and happines, is taking, even with carnal hearts.</p>
                     <p>Many, with the yong man in the Goſpell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 16.22. may be inquiſitive after eternall life, and have deſires to enjoy it, and take much paines to ſeeke after it, and be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſorrowfull at the thoughts of miſſing of it, and theſe imply, ſome taſtig of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly gift and the powers of the world to come. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. A man may be elevated with raptures of joy upon a ſuppoſed inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in heaven, and all this may be but in a natural way; like <hi>Haman</hi> he may, thinke, whom will the Lord honour but my ſelfe, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 6. but with the yong man he may minde earthly things more then Chriſt, or eternal life, <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22. Saith <hi>Forbes,</hi> as a Phyſitian that hath prepared a comfortable potion for the health of a beloved patient, he will give to others a little of it; to make them apprehend the taſt of it; but, not ſo as to have any ſtrength to make any operation in the ſtomacke: ſo, the Lord may let ſome carnal men diſcerne ſome goodnes in Chriſt and eternall life. But, theſe taſts doe not make them partakers of the refreſhing power of theſe. They may be wrought into a great reformation, and a glorious outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:119891:57"/>hereby; but, they have not ſuch an operation as to cauſe their hearts to mount up Chriſt-ward, and place their ſatisfaction in him alone. But the ſpeakings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit make the ſoule cry out, as, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10, 11. <hi>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt amongſt ten thouſand</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>He is altogether lovely.</hi> A ſoule at ſuch a day cannot but rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon Chriſt the top of its glory, and it can finde no reſt, but in him and Communion with him, and the ſmiles of his face; all other things are nothing to theſe, in its account. Reall-taſts that the Lord is gracious, cauſe the ſoule to diſreliſh carnal delights, and imbitter thoſe ſweets to it. Saith the ſoule, ſhould I be taken with the ſmiles of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is not the ſmiling face of Chriſt bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? ſhould I be drunke with the ſweet cups of worldly delights, is not the Wine in Chriſts Cellar better? ſhould I feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aſhes after Chriſt hath led me into his banqueting houſe? O no. <hi>Whither ſhould I goe? Thou haſt the words of eternall life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, I ſhall proceed to the other Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu:</hi> 2. HOw may a ſoule know that the Spirit hath witneſſed its Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Blood?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ:</hi> 1. From the New Covenant or the free promiſe: we are not to thinke that there is an application of material blood; but the Goſpell diſcovereth that the bloud of Chriſt which was ſhed upon the Croſſe, was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and is uſefull, for Juſtification, Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. and offereth it, for ſuch uſes and ends unto particular ſoules. The application of blood is by faith: <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be by a promiſe, becauſe faith ever muſt have a Divine word to faſten upon, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 <hi>v.</hi> 8.10. The Apoſtle checketh &amp; reproveth for ſuch carnal apprehenſions, as, that we muſt clamber up to heaven for the blood of Chriſt: No (ſaith he) the Lord reacheth it forth, and maketh it nigh to us, in or by the word of faith: and the ſame word promiſeth beleevers that they ſhall be ſaved. <hi>v.</hi> 9. So that, a Divine word is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for the conveyance of the blood of Chriſt unto ſoules, and for their aſſurance
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:119891:58"/>of ſalvation thereby. This is Gods Deed of gift, which they have to ſhew for their right and title to that blood, and all advantages that come by it: and their Acquittance or diſcharge from the debt they did owe to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Many are poſſeſſed with apprehenſions that it is impoſſible to attaine aſſurance of intereſt in that blood of Chriſt, and are filled with inward porplexities about it, for want of conſidering the written word as the means of conveyance. Whereas, if the promiſe of it be yours, the blood in the ſeverall uſes it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to, is yours alſo, and that ought to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie you: for there is an inſeparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between blood and the Covenant. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 16.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 20.</p>
                     <p>And your Concluſions of intereſt in any priviledges that come in by it, ought to be grounded, and built upon a free promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 18.22.29. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.15.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From Cordiall acts of faith in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the blood of Chriſt: Faith is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make the promiſe become particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to a ſoule. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9.10. <hi>With the heart man beleeveth unto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>—</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There muſt be beleeving; which is the acceptation of that blood from Chriſt, in the free promiſe:<note place="margin">What beleeving is, as it hath reference to Juſtification.</note> or a conſenting to the free offer of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119891:59"/>it, that it may be uſefull to the ſoule in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular for ſuch ends as it ſerveth to. If thou haft heartily accepted of it, then the promiſe and the blood or righteouſneſſe of Chriſt tendred therein, are both undoubtedly thine. The primitive act of faith, doth not conſiſt in a perſwaſion that Chriſt is mine, or ſhed his blood for me: this (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Burroughs</hi> ſaith) is, the creame of faith, the riches of ſaith: and a man muſt be intereſted in that bloud in order before that beliefe, elſe it is a falſe faith. But, beleeving muſt conſiſt in conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or receiving; to anſwer the offer. And hence, receiving Chriſt, and beleeving on his name, are made one. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. And, in this reſpect Juſtification is ſo often aſcribed to Faith, in oppoſition to workes. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 20.28. <hi>We conclude that a man is juſtified by faith, without the deeds of the Law.</hi> Gal. 2.16. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a man is not juſtified by the workes of the Law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

It lieth out of a mans ſelfe, is not a mans owne but by free donation on Gods part, and reception on his part. And hence the Apoſtle maketh that the grand difference, between the Law and the Goſpell. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribeth the righteouſneſs which is of the law, that the man which doth thoſe

And thus Faith doth juſtiſie, not as a Grace, or as a worke or Quality; but as a meanes or inſtrument Commiſſionated by the Lord, for the reception of that blood of Chriſt which doth juſtifie. And hence it is called <hi>the righteouſneſſe by and through faith. Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6. It is not the act but the object of faith that Juſtifieth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p>Some men doe not reſt upon any other righteouſneſſe, nor this neither. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.30. <hi>The Gentiles followed not after righteouſneſſe.</hi> Others, may follow after righteouſneſs, yea and cry earneſtly for the blood of Chriſt to; but, riches, honours, pleaſures, performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, carnal company, baſe luſts, ſomething below or beſides Chriſt is more affected. <hi>Joh</hi> 5.44. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 31, 32, 33.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. From the renuntiation of whatſoever ſtandeth in competition with the blood of Chriſt, in thoſe uſes and ends it ſerveth to: A man may beare up himſeife with Chriſts ſhedding of his blood for ſinners &amp;c. and hereupon was confident of ſalvation, but if there be a going about to eſtabliſh a mans owne righteouſneſſe, there cannot be a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt at the ſame time. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. the heart cannot be engaged to irreconcilable oppofites at once. The great thing magnified by carnal Goſpellers is, their owne righteouſneſſe, but <hi>Paul</hi> declared an utter unwillingnes to be found in that, or in any thing but the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9.

A beleever, by want
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:119891:61"/>of illuminations, or violent temptations, may be hurryed into a reſting upon ſome particular duties, but the determinations of his will, and the maine bent of his inward man, are againſt it. He would not for a world offer ſuch diſ-reſpect to Chriſt, and declareth his utter diſallowance of it afterward.</p>
                     <p>Many acknowledge that they could never have yeelded perfect obedience to the Law, but muſt have been under the curſe ſtill, if Chriſt had not taken away the rigorouſneſſe of it: and now, they build their confidences upon Chriſt in conjunction with their own actings, in this way of mitigation; as, their praying, reading, hearing, loving and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, and offering no wrong to their neighbour &amp;c. but as, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2. <hi>If you be Circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi> It is evident that they did expect to be profited by Chriſt: but, (ſaith the Apoſtle) if you ſeeke to be juſtified by any one worke, and Chriſt together, then you looke for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to the tenor of the Law, and ſo will have no advantage by Chriſt, but are debtours to the whole Law, as, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. Such men own merits in practiſe, when they pretend to deny them in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Faith is a neceſſary and effectuall meanes of our participation of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, which is indeed availeable to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:119891:62"/>And Goſpell workes, with faith, are uſefull for the manifeſtation thereof. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 18.24. And thus they may raiſe expectations of ſalvation, as ſpeaking them intereſted in Chriſt and his obedience, which undoubtedly hath ſalvation promiſed to it. But neither faith nor workes can be the leaſt particle of that righteouſneſſe which the Lord hath promiſed [the ſalvation it ſelfe] unto. 1. Becauſe the two wayes of faith and workes, are incompatible one with the other, and ſo can admit of no mixture: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. <hi>And the Law is not of faith</hi> — i. c. Let no man thinke to mixe them together; for, the Law preſents to God a mans owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe [<hi>He that doth them,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhall live in them</hi>] but faith receiveth Chriſts righteouſneſſe for a gift. No man can attaine eternall life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the righteouſneſſe of the morall Law, or Law of workes. In the way of workes, a man is to fulfill this righteouſneſſe himſelfe. In the way of faith it is fulfilled for him, by his ſurety, Chriſt; and he is made a partaker of it by receiving. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5 <hi>v</hi> 17, 18, 19.21. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe then the reward ſhould be of debt, and ſo not of grace, either of which are contrary to. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. <hi>To him that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is the reward reckoned not of grace, but of debt.</hi> Perfect obedience due and owing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119891:62"/>to God as Creator, and without a promiſe intervening, could not have made God a debtor to his creature; neither could that have been of value to deſerve life. But if man had yeelded perfect obedience; then by vertue of that Covenant or promiſe, of <hi>Do this and live,</hi> it had become a debt. Now, if Evangelicall actings had ſuch a promiſe made to them, or if the promiſe were partly to Chriſt, and partly to them; then indeed, there were more of grace in the condition, but the promiſe were equally binding, and ſo, the reward were no leſſe of debt, after the performance of it. Salvation is a debt to Chriſt, but onely free grace and the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, (not our Evangelicall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dſence) can make it a debt to us: or can make any promiſe eſtabliſh an obligation upon the Lord, to give out life, or ſalvation to us. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. Neither is there ſalvation in any other. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.3.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. From its freenes in choofing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of the blood of Chriſt for the uſes and ends it ſerveth to: A man may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto God as Creator, and uſe earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for mercy, and yet not finde it. He may plead a promiſe, and that with importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and yet miſſe of ſalvation, if he taketh it not as, [in Chriſt]. For, the Lord hath made no promiſe, but in Chriſt. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119891:63"/>and is reſolved to be mercifull unto none, but in the way of the Mediatour; and hence Chriſt is called, <hi>the Mediatour of the Covenant. Hebr.</hi> 8.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.24. Not one Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant mercy, but muſt paſſe through his hands unto ſoules. So that, if your hearts have not owned his Mediation, his blood cannot be witneſſing to you. Many will not come to Chriſt that they might have life, and peace. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.41, 42. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is averſe to being beholden to another for all, and ſo, many doe not owne the way of ſalvation. But, there may be a crying out earneſtly for the blood of Chriſt, and if it be by conſtraint, ſo as the bent and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoule be not that way, then it is not with the heart. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25.27. <hi>Iſrael</hi> engaged that whatſoever the Lord ſhould ſpeake to them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> they would heare and doe it: and doubtles they meant as they ſaid; for, the Lords uttering his voyce out of the fire, and ſtriking them with the feare of death thereby, this occaſioned their making that promiſe; and yet the Lord ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>O that there were ſuch a heart in them</hi> — which implyeth more then a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that their whole hearts were not in this engagement.</p>
                     <p>So, the ſtingings and awakenings of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the ſervile feare of a curſe, wrath,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119891:63"/>hell, damnation — theſe may force into en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, to owning the blood of Chriſt: but theſe being extorted from them, the LORD doth not account their hearts in them.</p>
                     <p>It is with many, as with one that hath the Gangren, or ſome ſore diſeaſe, upon a member of his body, and there is no way to ſave his life, but by ſawing off the member; if the man ſubmitteth to this, yet it is with abundance of unwillingnes, meerly for the preſervation of life: ſo, many finde the voyce of God to be a killing voyce, without a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, and to avoyde eternall death, which elſe is inevitable, they will looke to the blood of Chriſt; but it is not out of a free choyce, but becauſe they cannot ſhift it, and eſcape wrath. I grant, men are to looke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the blood of Chriſt, for freedome from wrath: whither elſe ſhould they looke for this? and this obtained is a great priviledge. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Being juſtified by [his blood] we ſhall be ſaved from [wrath]</hi> &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.</p>
                     <p>But, a ſeing God as he is. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 2. and a fruition of his favour, and unexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tokens of his love, and the attaining ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting communion with Chriſt &amp;c. theſe are included in Goſpell Salvations, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is but the leaſt part of them. And, when the ſoule freely chooſeth this compleate ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119891:64"/>above all other things, and freely owneth the mediation of Chriſt as the means to it, then blood is witneſſing, elſe not. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. From its being drawne out with ſuch ſtrength after the blood of Chriſt, as it hath been after other things which undoubtedly the heart hath been ſet upon, and had free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for: An unbeleevers utmoſt (if he did come up to it) is not the utmoſt of his heart, becauſe he is under prevailing engagements to fin and Satan, and is like one in chaines.

A man may in a ſlighty overly way deale with the blood of Chriſt, not from terrours of Conſcience, but from a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous freenes, making a light matter both of finning, and going to that for pardon of ſin: and ſuch dallyance with the blood of Chriſt, is deſpiſing in Gods account, &amp; ſuch muſt expect the ſoreſt puniſhments, in ſtead of great ſalvations. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.29. No belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but can ſee his heart was ſet upon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides Chriſt, before his beleeving: Now, if the blood of Chriſt be as attractive as other things have been; and interruptions in its purſuance after that, as burdenſome, grievous, and afflictive to it, as they were
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119891:64"/>there: Or if the drawings of that blood be ſtronger and more forcible then of any, or all other things; that it will leave all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, it hath placed gaine in formerly, to preſſe after that; if that hath a commanding power of eſtate, life and all, then it is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the heart, and it is witneſſing. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9.14.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. From its feeling the efficaciouſneſſe of that blood: mens hearts are ſaid to be ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from an evil conſcience, by the blood of Chriſt <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 19.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.24. when ſpiritual enemies have brought in ſtrong charges againſt a ſoule, and if it might have followed its owne inclination, it would have joyned with Satan againſt it ſelfe; yet it hath been cauſed to oppoſe the blood of Chriſt, in the free promiſe, to all; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was ſecured againſt all the roarings of the Law, &amp; temptations of Satan; that now they are all ſilenced, their accuſations are anſwered, and a ſpiritual tranquillity and peace is eſtabliſhed there.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu:</hi> 1. HOw may a ſoule know that its heart is ſeparated from ſin, or that ſin hath not dominion over it, and ſo that it is Adopted?</p>
                     <p>Before I anſwer directly to the Queſtion, I ſhall lay downe foure diſtinctions, which may helpe weake, doubting Chriſtians, as they will diſcover how farre there may be ſin, and yet one not be under the dominion of it.</p>
                     <p>There is a Difference.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diſtinct.</hi> 1. Between the indwelling of ſin, and the reigning of ſin: <hi>Paul</hi> was an eminent beleever, and yet ſin dwelt in him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17. ſo 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8. A ſlave, a captive, may dwell in a houſe, and yet have no Commanding power there. Sin may dwell in the heart, and yet have no dominion there. Conclude not thy ſelfe under the reigne of ſin, barely becauſe thou findeſt the in-being, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Between the Soveraigntie of ſin, and the Tyrannie of ſin: the Saints have the aſſurance of a Divine promiſe, <hi>that ſin ſhall not ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119891:67"/>over them,</hi> Rom. 6.14. But yet belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are in part liable to the tyrannie of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. <hi>What I hate that doe I</hi> &amp; <hi>v</hi> 16.23. <hi>I ſee another Law in my members warring againſt the Law of my minde, and bringing me [into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie] to the Law of ſin</hi> — Thou mayeſt not onely finde ſtrong ſtirrings of corruption within thy ſelfe, but corrupt motions may ſometimes prevaile to drive thee into ſome ſin; may take the priſoner and lead the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for a time, and that when thou haſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged warre againſt them, &amp; yet ſin not reigne in thee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But what difference can there be, between the Saints and others, if they may be taken captive?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. A Beleevers, is but a partiall cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, an unregenerate mans is a totall: <hi>Paul</hi> had a law in his minde that made reſiſtance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 16.23. <hi>It was what he would not</hi> — the prevailing part of his will oppoſed. Whereas others are wholly or in the greateſt part captivated; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 13.17. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. Now, a voluntary ſubjection is that which maketh the reigning power. Sins of beleevers, are but with an incompleate will.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is both a Soveraigne and a Tyrant to unbeleevers. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. and but a Tyrant to beleevers.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Its Tyrannie over the Saints is by uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119891:67"/>but it hath a right of Dominion over others. Satan maketh a forcible entry upon the Saints, whereas others are his proper Subjects. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.30.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Beleevers make warre againſt ſin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. Others want ſpiritual armour to fight with. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Satan captivateth beleevers but for a little ſeaſon; by and by they get victory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and captivitie is led captive. Others at all times are in captivitie.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Many gracious ends the Lord doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh by it in the Saints, which others are without. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7 23, 24. It humbled <hi>Paul,</hi> and much abaſed him, that he ſhould beled captive by ſin. [<hi>O wretched man that I am</hi> —].</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Beleevers make out to Chriſt for helpe; others cry not out to be reſcued by him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Between an habituall frame of heart towards ſin, and an occaſionall falling into ſin: the former argueth the reigne of ſin, the latter not: for, by the violence of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <hi>David</hi> became guilty of murder and adultery, and <hi>Peter</hi> of denying Chriſt. Yet, beſides the after repentance which undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly follow ſuch falls, as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.45. there is a habituall prevailing inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt ſin in beleevers, which is never loſt, which differenceth them from others.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119891:68"/>It is not their path, their way they walke in, but as ſickneſſes to the body, or Eclipſes to the Sun, they come very ſeldome. Wicked men may have agues, or hot fitts againſt ſin, and gracious men may have cold fitts in ſin, but the bent of their ſoules, and their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe is another way.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Between infirmities, and groſſer enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: the former are incident to the Saints more frequently: as, every day, and often, there will be vaine thoughs, and words, and corruptions may get ſome advantages, and graces may not act at ſuch a height as they ought to doe, and there may be backwardnes to ſome duties, and diſtractions in them &amp;c. Such ſins of infirmitie (though more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent) yet are conſiſtent with truth of grace.</p>
                     <p>But to prevent miſtakes, know.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That freedome from the dominion of ſin, doth alwayes, vaſtly difference the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe, or Converſation, from ſuch as are under the reigne of it: many call their groſſe ſins, but ſins of infirmity: whereas, thoſe that ſeeme very ſmall ſins in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by the aggravating circumſtances which they admit of, may not be reckoned of infirmitie. But, ever there is a vaſtly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent converſation before and after converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. Thoſe that are called out
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119891:68"/>of this world cannot but walke otherwiſe, then thoſe that are of it. Though a man (with <hi>Paul</hi>) was very religious before, and as touching the Law blameles; yet, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion differenceth him from himſelfe in his former ſtate, in point of converſation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 3.6. and a frequent iteration of manifeſt workes of the fleſh, on living in them, is made a certaine evidence of a ſtate of nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20, 21. <hi>Now the workes of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are, adultery, fornication, uncleaneneſſe, laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, ſtrife, ſeditions, hereſies, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyings, murders, drunkenneſſe, revellings, and ſuch like</hi> — v. 21. <hi>They which doe ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the kingdome of God.</hi> Such are under the dominion of ſin.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Sins, when really of infirmitie, are, ſuch are (through the remainders of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and weakneſſe of the regenerate part) are unavoydable, or are againſt the maine bent and inclination of the will. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15, 16. <hi>What I would not, and what I hate, that doe I.</hi> Gal. 5.17. <hi>Ye cannot doe what you would.</hi> It is onely out of impotency or weaknes to withſtand, that corruption prevaileth; not out of want of will to hinder it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>To will is preſent with me, but how to performe that which is good, I finde not.</hi> The will againſt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119891:69"/>it, is ſtronger then its ability to make reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: the temptation is overcome in the will, though it prevaileth; elſe, I cannot underſtand how it is of infirmitie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may be knowne that ſin hath not dominion over a man, from his choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing freedome, or his conſenting with all his heart, upon Evangelicall accounts to part with ſin: herein conſiſts the very reigne of ſin, in the voluntary ſubjection of the whole man to it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13, 14.16. <hi>To whom ye [yeeld your ſelves] ſervants to obey, his ſervants ye are, to whom ye obey, whither of ſin</hi> — So that a free yeelding up to the ſervice of ſin, is the reigning of it; and therefore a heartie choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and conſenting to part with it, or a thorow unwillingnes to ſin, muſt needs ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue freedome from that reigne of it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting expreſſeth <hi>Pauls</hi> ſubjection to Gods Law, when he fell ſhort in practiſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.16. And ſo, a heartie conſenting to part with ſin, argueth freedome from the reigne of it, even when one is ruſhed into the acting of it. And hence, ſuch as the Lord rejecteth and appeareth in the dreadfulleſt way againſt, are deſcribed by their chooſing that wherein the Lord delighteth not. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 65. <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
                     <p>Meaſure your ſelves by your choice: you may be reſtrained from the groſſe ſins, that others commit, but if you chooſe ſin, it is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119891:69"/>all one in Gods account as if you acted it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.28.</p>

                     <p>BUt in regard wicked men may have ſome unwillingnes to commit ſome ſins; and to helpe weake Chriſtians, I ſhall adde ſome diſcoveries, when there is [a heartie choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing freedome from ſin, and a heartie unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnes to ſin] ſuch as the Goſpel owneth as an Evidence of Adoption.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When it is free in its choice, or without coaction: the Apoſtle maketh an oppoſition between doing by conſtraint, and doing wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. and between acting out of neceſſitie and willingly. <hi>Phil. v.</hi> 14. which clearely intimate, that if a man acteth in Goſpel duties (as thoſe were which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts to) yet if it be by neceſſitie or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, then it is not willingly, in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Things that a man is obliged to, by the neceſſitie of a Divine Command, yet if there be not a freenes in coming up to them, it is not willingly, or out of choyce, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable obedience to the Lord. He that is in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119891:70"/>a tempeſt caſts his merchandize into the Sea, not properly by compulſion, but by a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of a ſuppoſition or condition. <hi>i.e.</hi> if he will ſave the Ship and his life, he muſt caſt out the goods, yet he doth not this willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>i.e.</hi> not with a voluntary freenes: and yet with a kinde of willingnes. <hi>i.e.</hi> rather then looſe his life, and all, he will caſt out the goods; ſuch acts he doth willing with a nilling minde, or nilling with willing minde.</p>
                     <p>So, a man may acknowledge, not onely in the generall that he is a ſinner, but even particular ſins, and may really wiſh them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>committed, and make promiſes and take up reſolutions for the future not to commit them, and may without diſſimulation. <hi>i.e.</hi> not feignedly, but meaning as he ſaith, be unwilling to commit ſome ſin that he is preſſed on to; and yet may be under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin ſtill. He chooſeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth to part with ſin rather then to be damned; or, to avoyde eternall death, and wrath to come, horrours of conſcience, or ſuch like foreſeen dangers; Alas, this is but by neceſſitie or conſtraint, and ſo it is not willingly. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> concluded his ſinfulnes. <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.16. and <hi>Judas. Matth.</hi> 27.3. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented himſelfe, <hi>v.</hi> 3.. <hi>i.e.</hi> it was ſo imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to him, as he was ſorry for what he had
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:119891:70"/>done, and wiſhed it had been otherwiſe: and both were reall in what they ſaid; for it was their diſtreſſe that made them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and becauſe <hi>Judas</hi> caſt away the gaine he had by his ſin. <hi>v</hi> 5. But, all this being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from them by Conſcience, they were under the dominion of ſin ſtill. If it be a free choyce, that ſuppoſe there were no danger of wrath, hell or damnation for ſin, yet the nature of ſin would make you deny ſervice or ſubjection to it; then, you are not under the dominion of ſin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16.22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 34.36.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When the choice is univerſall: when it conſenteth to part with all ſin: Not that a man can be really freed from one ſin, who is under the reigning power of others: but, he may be reſtrained from many, and yet be freed from the ruling power of none. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>v.</hi> 104.128. <hi>I hate [every] falſe way. Pſal.</hi> 139.23. <hi>Search me O God — and ſee if there be [any] wicked way in me</hi> — He was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to have any ſin finde entertainment in his heart. The ſubduing of one ſin may diſcover freedome from the dominion of all, when the heart is carryed out againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of fin, in that one. But, the hearts indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging one (though never ſo ſmall) argueth the dominion of all: for, the leaſt partaketh of the nature of ſin, as well as, the greateſt.

                        <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11. The Apoſtles ſcope is, to advance love without reſpect of perſons. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. and enforceth it this way; <hi>for, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all.</hi> And addeth this reaſon of it, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>For, he that ſaid, doe not commit adultery, ſaid alſo doe not kill.</hi> It is taken from the authoritie of the Commander: if this did oblige to one Command, the ſame obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would extend to all; becauſe there is the ſame Divine authoritie ſtamped upon one, as upon another.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When the choice is abſolute without condition: a man may have a reall unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnes to commit one ſin, &amp; yet if it ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in competition with another ſin, or ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inordinately affected; he will rather commit it, then relinquiſh theſe. <hi>Pilate</hi> was unwilling to condemne Jeſus, as appeared by his ſeeking to releaſe him, and his waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hands &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. <hi>v.</hi> 18.24. And <hi>Herod</hi> was unwilling to behead <hi>John Baptiſt, Mark.</hi> 6.26, 27. The King was exceeding ſorry. <hi>Darius</hi> was unwilling to caſt <hi>Daniel</hi> into the Lyons Den. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 14.18, 19, 20. He was ſore diſpleaſed with himſelfe, and ſet his heart on <hi>Daniel</hi> to deliver him, could neither eate, drinke, or ſleepe, the night af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was caſt in, and rejoyced exceedingly at <hi>Daniels</hi> ſafetie. <hi>v.</hi> 20. All which argue a

There was a defect here, they were more unwilling to ſtaine their honours, then to commit the ſins; and they chooſe the ſin rather then their owne ſufferings that way.</p>
                     <p>Thus, a man may be ſo unwilling to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a ſin, as he may take much paines to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the commiſſion of it, and may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſorry that he hath been drawne away to it; he may weep for it, and have no reſt night or day after he hath been ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; and yet be under the ruling power of it ſtill. This is the language of his heart, I would not commit this ſin, but rather then I will part with this pleaſure, that profit, theſe honours, I will doe that which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I am unwilling to doe. If there be any condition in the world, that will hire thee into ſin, it is not a heartie choice.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When there is a conflict between the fleſh. <hi>i.e.</hi> ſin, and the Spirit in the ſoule by this choice: <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18, 19. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh</hi> — and his ſcope is to diſcover by this conflict, who ſhall inherit the kingdome of God, and who not; and who are given up to fulfill the luſts of the fleſh, and who not, as, <hi>v.</hi> 16.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. When it is between the right par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>i.e.</hi> the fleſh and the Spirit. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. There may be a great ſtrugling in a mans Spirit, by the enterfering of one corruption with another; or, between the inclination of the will to the commiſſion of ſome ſin, and the dictates of the natural Conſcience. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. Or, between the judgement and inclination to that which is morally good; and very corrupt affections. But unleſſe it be between the Spirit and the fleſh it is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When the oppoſition is made by the hidings of the Word in the heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. <hi>Thy Word have I hid in my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9. <hi>For his ſeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in him, and he cannot ſin</hi> — The word within, is a ſeed that oppoſeth ſin. Thou mayeſt have a hundred Scriptures forbidding a particular ſin, which the fleſh luſteth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and as many promiſes of helpe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; all theſe may be eyed, and thought upon, and ſome affections may be ſlightly touched herewith: but, if thy heart hath not treaſured up theſe words, thou mayeſt be ruſhed into the ſin, in the face of all theſe. But when the heart engageth by the word againſt ſin, then it is evidencing; for, the word is the ſword of the Spirit. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.17. The following particulars will further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119891:72"/>when the Conteſt is between the fleſh and the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. When the ſoules chooſing freedome from ſin, doth lead to, and end in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of ſin: that this is an evidence of Adoption is cleare. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye by the Spirit, doe mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi> There may be a ceſſation from the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a ſin, and yet no mortification of it. He that hath been a drunkard, ſwearer, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-breaker &amp;c. may deſiſt from theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane practiſes, which he hath followed, and yet be under the dominion of ſin ſtill. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.11.13.</p>
                     <p>There may be a change of ſin, and no change of heart; one ſin may be left and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taken in the roome of it. A ceſſation chiefly reſpecteth the acts of ſin, and aimeth at the repreſſing of them; but, mortification ſtriketh at the root, the nature of ſin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. aimeth at the deſtruction of it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>That the body of ſin might be deſtroyed</hi> — Yea, in ſome meaſure it extinguiſheth the vigour, and expelleth or driveth out the very life of ſin.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When there is an irreconcileable oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the ſoule againſt ſin: a man may miſlike the way it cometh in, as having ſome ill conſequences attending it, and there may be a kinde of parting upon it; ſin may ſeeme
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119891:73"/>to ſoffer baniſhment, for a time upon ſome particular diſcontents againſt it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 43, 44, 45. The uncleane Spirit, <hi>i.e.</hi> Sin or Satan, is gone out of a man; but, <hi>v</hi> 44. <hi>it returneth,</hi> — there is a re-entrance, and <hi>the latter end of that man is worſe then the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> But if there be ſuch enmitie againſt, and deteſtation of ſin, as it can upon no termes admit of any reconciliation; that mountaines of gold, nor the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, can win the leaſt token of favour or reſpect from the ſoule towards ſin; but it cryeth out under it, as, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>O wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched man that I am</hi> — then it is freed from the dominion of ſin.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. When it is upon ſpirituall and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall accounts, that it chooſeth freedome from ſin: A man may be incenſed againſt ſin upon natural, civil, moral, and religious accounts, and yet be under the dominion of ſin ſtill. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. <hi>They have a zeale of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu:</hi> When doth a man chooſe freedome from ſin, upon Evangelicall accounts?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. When the contrariety of ſin to the will of God in Chriſt, doth diſ-ingage the heart from it: Chriſt is often called a King, a Lord, a Law-giver—to note, that all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, whither injoyning duties or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſins, they are to be received not onely as from the hands of an All-powerfull, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:119891:73"/>infinitely juſt God, but as from the hands of the Mediatour.</p>
                     <p>Not, but that a ſoule is to looke upon ſin as a violation of the Fathers will, yet, his will, not according to the tenor of the old Covenant. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11. but, as he hath revealed it in the new Covenant, &amp; as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded over againe by Chriſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.15. <hi>Keep [my Commandments]</hi> &amp; 21.23. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.34. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.27. to the end of the Chapter. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.21. <hi>I am under the Law [to Christ]</hi> So that the loweſt duty ought to be ſervice to Chriſt. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. <hi>v</hi> 5, 6. <hi>Servants are to obey their Maſter in ſingleneſſe of heart [as unto Chriſt].</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may feare ſin, and be ſorry for it, and make oppoſition againſt it, as contrary to the will of God as Creator, but if its ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Chriſt as Redeemer, carry not out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, it is not Evangelicall, nor wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When a ſight of the injury offered to Chriſt by ſin, doth carry out the heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: a man may have a ſorrow for, a feare of, and hatred againſt ſin, as procuring diſcredit, or loſſe of reputation, ſufferings &amp;c. and yet be under the dominion of it ſtill. But, when the ſoule is touched with a deep ſenſe of it, in Chriſts ſufferings for and by it, when its piercing, wounding, and grieving
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:119891:74"/>of Chriſt, doth melt the heart for it, then it acteth Evangelically. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When a diſcoverie of the love, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and goodneſſe of God in Chriſt, is the conſtraining thing from ſin: when the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of the grace of God teach to deny ungodlines. <hi>Titus</hi> 2.13. and the goodneſſe of the Lord leadeth to repentance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. Ingenuity did exceedingly affect <hi>Sauls</hi> heart with his ſin. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.21. <hi>David</hi> had but cut aſunder the lap of his garment, when he might have cut aſunder the thred of his life; and this love and kindneſſe of <hi>David</hi> in ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life, drew out an acknowledgement of his ſin in the aggravations of it, for the preſent <hi>[I have ſinned, and erred exceedingly]</hi> yea, it put him upon reſolutions againſt it for the future <hi>[I will no more doe thee harme]</hi> A man may be much affected with a ſin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome great deliverance, or the like; may confeſſe it, in its aggravations, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very ingenuous conſiderations, and yet be under the dominion of it ſtill, as <hi>Saul</hi> was. But ſee how the Lord ſeeketh to affect the beart of <hi>David</hi> with his ſin. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9. <hi>I have anointed thee King over Iſrael &amp;c. And if this had been too little I would moreover have given unto thee ſuch and ſuch things. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haſt thou deſpiſed the Commandment of the Lord</hi> — And when this love of God had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:119891:74"/>his heart into an acknowledgment of his ſin. <hi>v.</hi> 13. preſently he had a ſentence of abſolution. He ſeemeth to be interrupted in ſpeaking out his ſorrow, with this <hi>[the Lord alſo hath put away thy ſin].</hi> When the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the former loving-kindneſſes of the Lord, doth melt the heart for ſin, this is ſoone followed up with a teſtimonie of remiſſion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When it aimeth at a Conformitie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt in its ſeeking freedomes from ſin. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22, 23. Cuſtome, and the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Forefathers, and the credit of religion in the Country or place a man liveth in, as alſo education &amp;c. may prevaile ſo farre as to reſtraine very much, and make a man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance ſin: but, except Chriſt be thy patterne of imitation, and thy ſorrow be becauſe thou falleſt ſo ſhort of him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth it not.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. When it aimeth at the coming up to ſome ſpeciall Goſpell duty, or the attaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome ſpeciall Goſpell priviledge, in ſeeking freedome from ſin: A man may ſee that ſin croſſeth ſome carnal intereſt, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth ſome outward diſadvantages, and may be incenſed againſt it upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: as, becauſe an inordinate uſe of the creature procureth diſeaſes to the body &amp;c. a parent may hate drunkennes, or unlawfull
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:119891:75"/>games, becauſe his childe is like to become a bankrupt by ſuch practiſes. A childe, being threatned to be diſ-inherited if he followeth ſuch wayes, may hereupon bridle his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yet may be under the reigning power of ſin ſtill. But if its hindring, in the exerciſe of ſome grace, or in the performance of ſome duty, or in the attainement of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt &amp;c. raiſe its feare of, ſorrow for, and hatred againſt ſin, then it acteth Evangelically. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>v.</hi> 2.7.13. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.1.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When it is by the application of the death of Chriſt in a promiſe, that it maketh reſiſtance againſt ſin: <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 4.14 <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 9.11. <hi>And they overcame by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their teſtimony — Joh.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 34.36. <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free, then you ſhall be free indeed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This muſt be an ingredient in all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer particulars; no freedome from ſin, but by Chriſt. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.71, 72.74, 75.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. When ſin it ſelfe is in ſubjection: there is an inconſiſtency, between ſins reigning and its being in ſubjection; it cannot be both King and Subject in the ſame ſoule at the ſame time. There may be a Conflict with ſin, and yet it may ſeeme to get the upper-hand for a time: but, when the ſoule hath gotten
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:119891:75"/>ſin beneath it; then it is moſt conſpicuous, that ſin doth not reigne. As;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When the ſoule is enabled to a ſpeedy mortification of it upon all its rebellions: it is like a conquered enemy, that is not able to keepe the field any longer; ſome parties may rallie, and make ſome reſiſtance, but they doe but haſten their owne ruine thereby: ſo, the motions and ſtirrings of ſin may be felt, but the ſoule is enabled to looke unto Chriſt, and to oppoſe the Word and blood of Chriſt to theſe, and it is ſpeedily ſaved. <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9.11. Sin, in the luſtings of it, is ſpeedily cruſhed, ſuppreſſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, it cannot prevaile upon the heart as formerly it hath done, but is layd lower by every onſet: this is the report that may be given upon their fighting, corruption is caſt out, caſt out. This argueth it hath not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When even the former prevailings of corruption, are made ſerviceable towards ſpiritual ends: as, when they produce ſoule-humiliation, ſelfe-abaſement, and fill it with the more admiration of, and cauſe it to be ſo much the more ſtudious for, the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the exceeding riches of grace in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening a way to deliverance from ſin. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.61.63. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 7. that it can tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over ſin through Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:119891:76"/>57. Then ſin is in ſubjection. And thus I have diſcovered, when a ſoule is freed from the Dominion of ſin: but before I leave this, I ſhall anſwer one objection.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> BUt is it poſſible that a ſoule may retaine Aſſurance, after it hath found the prevailings of Corruption? If it formerly had it, yet muſt it not unavoyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly looſe it, after a falling into ſin?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Premiſe</hi> 1. Sins are either of infirmitie one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; or groſſer ſins, which are the falls of the Saints.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prem.</hi> 2. Either there is a nouriſhing of theſe ſins, or an endeavour to the utmoſt after the mortification of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Aſſurance in the donation and continuation of it, hath a dependance on the free actings of the Divine Spirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6. And hence, if the Spirit pleaſeth, that can continue ſuch a worke upon the heart, at ſuch a time: and if that will ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend its operations, though no ſuch provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:119891:76"/>be given it to withdraw; yet it is not in the power of man to continue it one moment longer.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A man ought not to throw or caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Confidence ſo long as Scripturall grounds are afforded to found it upon: it is the groſſe miſtake of too many Chriſtians, if they fall into ſin, they reckon it their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then to queſtion their eſtates, &amp; to throw up all former perſwaſions of intereſt in Chriſt: whereas, this is very ſinfull: it not onely wanteth a word to warrant it, for a duty; but it is denyed by the word to be one. They ought to hold faſt their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence firme unto the end. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.6. <hi>&amp; Iſai.</hi> 49.14. She is upbraided for ſaying <hi>the Lord had forſaken her</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>You are not to caſt it away but upon a Scripture-ground; and ſeing it is evident that falls are conſiſtent with intereſt in Chriſt, as in the caſe of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> hence, you cannot have a warrant from the word, to make this an argument of being without Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The nouriſhing of Corruption hath a tendency to deprive the ſoule of Aſſurance: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12. and therefore it is extreamely dangerous to cheriſh the leaſt ſin.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If thou enquireſt whither Aſſurance
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:119891:77"/>may ſtand with the nouriſhing any ſin: either thy Queſtion muſt looke to the time paſt, preſent, or to come. If to the time preſent, or to come, know, that the Lord hath not granted thee liberty one moment, for the nouriſhing any corruption; and ſo, it is a ſin to be ſtudious to make Aſſurance and any ſin dwell together. Put an end to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, by ceaſing to nouriſh for the preſent, and by ſeeking to prevent nouriſhing any ſin for the future.</p>
                     <p>But if it reſpecteth the time paſt; that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly thou didſt nouriſh ſome corruption, thy after mortification of it is witneſſing.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I ſuppoſe Aſſurance may be retained, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not only ſins of infirmitie; but alſo after the fals of the Saints, when thoſe ſins are not nouriſhed. That it may continue after ſins of infirmitie is undenyable, becauſe elſe it were impoſſible for any to retaine it; ſeing the beſt of Saints are ſubject to theſe, dayly. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15.24. And for other ſins, ſee, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20.22. They had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty of great wickedneſſe, and were afraid of death for it, but <hi>Samuel</hi> forbiddeth this feare, and calleth them up unto confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the Lord would not forſake them, <hi>v.</hi> 22. for his owne names ſake. <hi>Micah</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Though I fall, yet I ſhall ariſe</hi> — Here is Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and yet under a fall, and it is into ſin.

From his eſteeming of God and Chriſt, above all other things: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.26, 27. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee?</hi> a beleever would account even heaven it ſelfe, a place of but little beautie, glory or felicitie, if Communion with God and Chriſt were not to be injoyed in it. Others deſire Chriſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for heaven, he deſireth heaven chiefly for Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Naturall men are even drunke and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in Creature delights; but, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Chriſt prevaileth with a gracious heart againſt all other intereſts. He may be interrupted in his motion to Chriſt, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular acts; but he is the prime, principall
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:119891:78"/>object his ſoule is moved, and bent towards, ſet and fixed upon, and given up to; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Coloſs.</hi> 1.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11. Chriſt is all and in all. Other-things are as nothing to him, if Chriſt be not injoyed in them; he is all in all injoyments; all in all inlargements, all in all duties, all in all comforts. Others apprehend that Chriſt it, better then the gnawings of an accuſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, better then the company of damned Spirits, better then flames; but, they ſee no ſuch beautie, or excellency in Chriſt, as ſhould make him beſt, or all in all here on earth.

From his ſpending his higheſt deſires and endevours after attaining Communion with God in Chriſt: when the heart is ſet upon Chriſt, or turned Chriſt-ward, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand ſtill without him, it muſt be wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for him, and enquiring after him with utmoſt diligence. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Saw ye not him
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:119891:78"/>whom my ſoule loveth?</hi> Pſal. 130.5, 6. Phil. 3.14.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From his willingnes to part with all other things at Chriſts Call, or for his ſake. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26.33. <hi>Whoſoever forſaketh not, [all that he hath,]</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> Matth. 10.37. <hi>He that loveth father or mother [more] then me, is not worthy of me</hi> —</p>
                     <p n="4">4. From the carriage of his heart under his withdrawings: when theſe procure ſuch heart-ſickneſſes, as can be cured no way, but by his returnings to it. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Tell him I am ſick of love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the feare of hell is not upon them, yet O, the ſighings, ſobbings, cryings, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, of love-ſicke ſoules, for Chriſt's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. No quiet or ſatisfaction without him. Like the childe, that nothing can ſtill, but the breaſt: ſo, nothing can fill up Chriſts roome in the ſoule. It reckoneth it ſelfe empty in the midſt of fulnes, without him. It is reſolved for ever to goe in widdow-hood, if he will not owne it as his Spouſe. This argueth a Conſent of heart to the Match, and ſo a marriage union between Chriſt and the ſoule.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. From his injoyment of the leadings of the Spirit: theſe are a certaine, infallible evidence of Adoption to all that have them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. <hi>For [as many] as are [led by the

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. When a Complyance with the will of Chriſt becometh naturall to the ſoule: as there is a propenſitie in light things to moove upward, and in heavie things to moove downward, ſo in the ſoule to moove Chriſt-ward. Suppoſe there were no wrath as the Conſequences of diſobedience; nor no reward as the effect of Goſpell obedience; yet, the ſweetnes of the wayes themſelves, &amp; the reſpect it oweth to the will of Chriſt, would be as the heart unto an owning of Chriſt therein. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.30.173. <hi>I have [choſen] the way of truth</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>for therein I delight.</hi> So, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>For, the law of the Spirit of life hath made me free, from the law of ſin and death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Carnall men, in their hearts, call a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for ſin, freedome: but ſuch as are indeed freed from condemnation, and walke after the Spirit, they call this their libertie, to be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:119891:79"/>free for Chriſt, and from the law of ſin; and reckon obligations to ſin the greateſt bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and thraldome in the world. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit raiſeth an admirable freenes in the ſoule to walke in the wayes of Chriſt. 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie:</hi> And hence the Spirit of Adoption is oppoſed unto the Spirit of bondage. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. A man may exerciſe himſelfe in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall part of all duties that a Chriſtian is engaged to, and yet be without the leadings of the Spirit. He may have many carnal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements hereunto: but, unleſſe there be a libertie of heart to theſe wayes; that he would not but be imployed in them, and accounteth it a high favour from the Lord that he will uſe him in any ſervices for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and findeth more delectation in theſe, then in any other wayes; that it becometh even meate and drinke to him, to doe the Lord ſervice, and it is a matter of great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint and lamentation, that he can doe no more for the Lord; that he findeth a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes in himſelfe, or any contrary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which ſeek to obſtruct and hinder his following the Lord in his wayes. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22, 23. Then he injoyeth the leadings of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When it hath corroborations or aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt thoſe impediments that would
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:119891:80"/>hinder it, in walking in the wayes of Chriſt: or the Spirit leadeth by remooving theſe: Carnal men wonder that any ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine for want of ſtrength unto duties, they can eaſily come up to them. But, it ariſeth partly from Satans not moleſting them in the performance of duty, becauſe they looke not beyond the externall part of it; they ſtrive not to act in a right manner, or for right ends: or becauſe they are inſenſible of the working of corruption, when yet it doth act. But a gracious heart, findeth, that if it be not ſtrengthened by a power beyond its owne, it cannot act any grace, or performe any duty in an acceptable way to the Lord: and hence the Apoſtle prayeth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.16. <hi>That they might be [ſtrengthened with might by his Spirit] in the inner man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>led by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Iſai. 63. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14. And how doth he lead them? it is by dividing the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before them, and keeping them that they ſhould not ſtumble —. <hi>i.e.</hi> the Lord threw up and remooved impediments out of their way, and took away what might cauſe them to fall, and this was his leading of them. So, if thou haſt been eagerly purſued by Satan, and he hath raged againſt thee like a Lyon ſpoyled of his whelpes, that thou wert beſet with temptations, and did'ſt finde many and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:119891:80"/>ſtrong luſtings of the fleſh, to hinder thy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of the Lord Chriſt in the wayes of his appointment. And, if ſuch mountaines have been made plaines, and corruption borne downe; when thou haſt found thy heart ſo full of deadnes, hardnes, unbeliefe, and all manner of diſtempers, that thou haſt even deſpaired of acting in the duty, as, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er &amp;c. in any acceptable way to the Lord, and (like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>) thou haſt cryed out, that thy deſtruction was at hand.</p>
                     <p>Yet, if theſe ſpirituall enemies have been conquered, and thy heart let out more then at other times towards Chriſt; here are the leadings of the Spirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye by the Spirit mortifie</hi> — <hi>v.</hi> 14 <hi>For, as many as are led by the Spirit</hi> — The particle <hi>[For]</hi> argueth mortification to appertain unto the leadings of the Spirit. And, ſo, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Thoſe that are led, and doe walke by the Spirit, they [ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh].</hi> Not as if they were perfect, and had no ſin in them, for he addeth, <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit.</hi> It doth not quite hinder the ſtirrings, no nor the prevailings of ſin, for he ſaith <hi>[ye cannot doe what ye would]. i.e.</hi> ye cannot act ſo ſpiritually, and ſo circumſpectly, as ye would. Ye cannot, yet ye would. The will prevaileth againſt, and getteth the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-hand of corruption, even when duty is
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:119891:81"/>hindred, or ſin acted by the ſoule; that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is not predominant in the ſoule. Then they are the fruits of the ſpirit, when thy love to Chriſt is predominant, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily prevaileth againſt thy ſinfull love to other things below Chriſt: and thy Joy in the Lord is predominant or beareth ſway againſt thy ſinfull and carnall joy in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or luſts: and thy peace, by the blood of Chriſt, helpeth thee to ſee that falſe peace which thou hadſt taken up from other grounds: and thy faith is predominant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy unbeleife, which diſcovered it ſelf formerly, in cauſing thee to chooſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace other objects beſides Chriſt, or in thy not coming up to a hearty accepting of him; and ſo for all other fruits of the Spirit, <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23. There is an oppoſition made between the works of the fleſh, and of the Spirit, <hi>v.</hi> 19.22. to ſhew that when the works of the fleſh are kept underneath, and prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, then a ſoule enjoyeth the leadings of the Spirit, as <hi>v.</hi> 16.18.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 When the heart is under powerful draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings Chriſt-ward in being exerciſed in the wayes of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 There muſt be drawings. The word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:119891:81"/>by word of mouth, but of a hand to lead, helpe and uphold in a way. Or from weake perſons, as young children, that need a hand to ſuportand ſuſtaine; yea, an arme to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them. Men cannot goe alone in the wayes of Chriſt, they may pray and heare &amp;c. but they cannot mixe faith with theſe, or act ſpiritually, if the Spirit hath not a greater ſtroake in ſuch actions, then themſelves. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. <hi>Without me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ye can doe nothing.</hi> i. e. nothing in a pleaſing or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable way to God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.5. And, the Spouſe cryeth out. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Draw me:</hi> it denoteth impotency and unaptnes in the ſoule for ſuch a motion. No running after Chriſt, without drawings from him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They muſt be heart-drawings: if the heart be wanting, though a man performeth never ſo many duties, yet he is deſtitute of the leadings of the Spirit. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 5 <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 12. All love, or ſervice that findeth acceptance with the Lord is [with all the heart]. <hi>i. e.</hi> with the ruling, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing part of it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23. There is a Law in the minde. <hi>i. e.</hi> powerfull obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and engagements laid upon that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. The loweſt duties require the heart to the right performance of them. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The drawings of the heart muſt be
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:119891:82"/>Chriſt-ward: A man may be furniſhed with eminent gifts, and may have ſutable aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the laying out of thoſe gifts, from the Spirit, and yet may be without the leadings of the Spirit, as <hi>Saul.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.10. And Chriſt ſhall ſay, <hi>depart from me,</hi> to many that have propheſied and caſt out Devils, in his name, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.22, 23.</p>
                     <p>A man may have preaching gifts, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gifts, yea wonder-working gifts, and may lay out theſe to the admiration of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and all theſe are from the Spirit. 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11. and yet be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Son-ſhip, and therefore without the leadings of the Spirit which witnes adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. Theſe are rather for the profit of others, then for his that hath them. Gifts exerciſed cannot ſuppreſſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a mans owne heart, and hence, though they uſed their gifts, yet they are called <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of iniquitie.</hi> Math. 7.23. Gifts doe not carry out the heart towards Chriſt, but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doe. And, if in the improvement of preaching, or praying gifts, thy heart hath been carryed out Chriſt-ward, though thou haſt found more ſtreightnings in expreſſion then at other times, yet thou haſt injoyed the leadings of the Spirit. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 30. <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>I will cauſe him to draw neer — for, who is this that engageth his heart to approach unto me</hi> —
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119891:82"/>Then a man is cauſed by the Lord to draw neer unto him in any ſervices, when there are reall engagements upon his heart towards God: and ſuch the Lord will owne as his. <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>And ye ſhall be my people, and I will be your God.</hi> It a man hath had never ſo much enlargedneſſe in expreſſions in prayer, yet if his heart hath not been under drawings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt, it is not witneſſing, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.13, 14. But if a duty hath been of advantage that way, then thou haſt had the leadings of the Spirit, how meane ſoever the duty hath ſeemed to be. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.6.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When it hath been enabled to owne the mediation of Chriſt, and Goſpel promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in its actings: A mans heart may really goe out after ſome enjoyments, and faine he would have theſe; as riches, freedomes from affliction &amp;c. he may pray earneſtly for them; and yet he may be without the leadings of the Spirit. It is the worke of a faithfull Leader to carry a man in the right way: and the Spirit is promiſed, to ſpeake from God to us, for direction into the way we ſhould chooſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Thine ears ſhall heare a voyce behinde thee, ſaying, This is the way, walke ye in it</hi> — The Lord doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count himſelfe glorified by the beſt, and moſt ſhineing ſervices a ſoule can performe, nor doth not accept of them, if it dealeth not
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:119891:83"/>with him, by the Mediatour. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>To offer up ſpirituall ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, acceptable to God, [by Jeſus Chriſt].</hi> Many in words doe make uſe of Chriſt for accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with God: but unles your hearts have been holden up and ſtrongly drawne to make uſe of the name of Chriſt, and the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and interceſſion of Chriſt; you have not the leadings of the Spirit. And thoſe that attaine unto this, doe finde acceptance with God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>Coloſs.</hi> 3.17.</p>
                     <p>And Goſpell promiſes are the Caskets, wherein the jewell Chriſt Jeſus is layd up. The Chariots whereby a ſoule may ride to that King of glory in triumph. The Ships wherein it may imbarke it ſelfe, and goe full ſaile to him, for all the mercies it ſtands in need of. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 1.20. And when it heartily maketh uſe of Chriſt by theſe; then it injoyeth the leadings of the Spirit of promiſe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. When Spirituall things are thoſe which the heart is moſt affected and taken up with, and maketh out moſt after. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. <hi>They that are after the Spirit, do minde the things of the Spirit.</hi> i. e. minde them, as if they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to minde: or they minde theſe, farre more then any other things. They can ſee but little excellency in duties that others
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119891:83"/>may highly eſteeme of; if they finde not the breathings of the Spirit in them. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>We worſhip God in the Spirit.</hi> They worſhipped God in the fleſh before, in a carnall way, but now in the Spirit. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>What ſoever is of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi> i. e. is Spirituall.</p>
                     <p>When the Spirituality of any wayes, is the great attractive and drawing inducement to affecting of, and walking in, them. When a ſoule doth ſo ſavour the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that there is a readines of heart to cloſe with things, becauſe ſpirituall, and never thinketh it ſelfe ſpirituall enough &amp;c. this argueth the leadings of the Spirit. And hence, beleevers are deſcribed, by ſpirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 2.15. <hi>He that is ſpirituall.</hi> i.e. a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee ever, oppoſed to the naturall man. <hi>v.</hi> 14.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When it is enabled to act for ſpirituall and Goſpell ends, in Goſpell duties: when it would not aime at ſelfe-advancement, or its owne name and glory, as they did. <hi>Math.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 1.5. But when the great things it eyeth, or would eye in all actings are, the mortification of corruption, and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement of Communion with God and Chriſt, and increaſe of all grace, growth in faith, love, ſelfe-denyal &amp;c. And when it ſeeketh for outward mercies in a ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to theſe, and in a way of ſubſerviency to the intereſt and deſignes of Chriſt. And
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:119891:84"/>when, as the ultimate end of all, it ſeeketh the glory of God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. Then it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth the leadings of the Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hath its Adoption witneſſed to it.</p>
                     <p>And thus I having diſcovered particularly, How a ſoule may know that the Spirit hath witneſſed Adoption. 1. By it ſelfe. 2. By Blood. 3. By Water.</p>

                     <p>NOw I ſhall proceed to the Secondary Generall Evidences; many of which, if not all, will accompany the witneſſings of the Spirit in every one of thoſe wayes of witneſſing. By temptation they may be ſometimes interrupted, yet not long, whil'ſt a teſtimonie remaineth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Evidence</hi> 1. When a ſoule injoyeth the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſings of the Spirit, it hath more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manifeſtations of that excellency which is in the things it is aſſured of: If ſuch a word as this, cometh in a witneſſing way <hi>[the blood of Chriſt cleanſeth thee from all
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:119891:84"/>thy ſins].</hi> The Spirit raiſeth more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary apprehenſions of the blood of Chriſt. It heard of its vertue and excellency before, but now it can ſay, <hi>not halfe was told me.</hi> It highly prized it before, but its eſtimation thereof, is hereby heightned exceedingly. Now, nothing is comparable with the blood of Chriſt in its account.</p>
                     <p>So, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5. when he could ſay <hi>[thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin]</hi> then he could hold in no longer, but cryeth out, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven</hi> — Surely he accounted highly of forgiveneſſe before, O but he had not ſuch lively appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of it untill it was witneſſed to him. <hi>v.</hi> 5. And, now he writeth them bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that have a partnerſhip with him in this forgiving grace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Evid.</hi> 2. The witneſſings of the Spirit fill the ſoule with unexpreſſible admiration of that Divine love which appeareth in and about its Adoption: there were many paſſages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the ſoule which it paſſed over formerly and diſregarded, that now are brought to its freſh remembrance, and that to heighten its admiration. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold what manner of love is this</hi>—when they injoyed witneſſings, and could ſay <hi>[we are the Sons of God]:</hi> when they had that hope of ſeeing God, as he is, and of being made
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:119891:85"/>like to him. <hi>v.</hi> 2. Then their hearts were ſo full, that they could not hold without broaching their apprehenſions of this adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting love; and admiration is forced to ſtand in the roome of expreſſions: words are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plved with wondering [<hi>Behold what manner of love</hi> —] Deluſions may cauſe a man to wonder at his owne ſuppoſed freedomes from wrath, and advancements to happines: but Divine love is farre leſſe admired, then his owne advantage.</p>
                     <p>But where the witneſſings of the Spirit are injoyed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A ſoule diſcerneth unexpreſſible love of good will, in the firſt contrivance of its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption: it ſeeth that the wiſdome of the creature would have been for ever non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus'd, if it had been left to that, to finde out a way for its owne recovery; and it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mireth that God ſhould ſo love the world, as to ſend his Son, his onely Son, on this errand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. and upon viewing that, it cannot but ſay [<hi>what manner of love is this</hi>—].</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It findeth a love of compaſſion in his many ſtrivings with it, whil'ſt it was in a naturall condition: this light of the Spirit, helpeth it to looke a great way back, and it ſeeth the walkings and tender-hearted work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God towards it there; how he at ſuch
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:119891:85"/>and ſuch a time allured, perſwaded, and wooed it; when it was in the midſt of its rebellions againſt him; and though it went on frowardly, and in the ſtubbornenes of its heart, yet he iterated his invitations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and againe; and O (ſaith the ſoule) that he ſhould not give over and ſay, that his Spirit ſhould ſtrive no more with me <hi>[what manner of love is this?]</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. It vieweth his love of delight, which is diſcovered in its Adoption, and wondreth at that alſo: Beleevers ſee infinite condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion there, in regard of their owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe, and ſo cannot but cry out, with the Apoſtle. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. <hi>What manner of love is this?</hi> that [we] who were enemies and fought againſt the Lord of glory. [We] who were full of deformity, and in our blood, <hi>caſt out to the loathing of our perſons,</hi> that [we] ſhould be called <hi>the Sons of God;</hi> O height, depth, length, and bredth of this love. If we had been made but as hired ſervants, it had been an unſpeakable priviledge; but to be owned as Sons, this is farre beyond it, <hi>[What manner of love is this?]</hi>

Witneſſings of the Spirit procure ſorrow and ſelfe-correction for unkindneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes offered to the Lord: the ſoule ſeeth, how love wrought in the boſom of God towards it, in ſuch dealings as it put miſ-interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:119891:86"/>upon before, and had hard thoughts of God for: and then the heart worketh on this manner. O I have ſaid the Lord hath forſaken me, my God hath forgotten me; but now I ſee his thoughts were precious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me even then. I had wretchedly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten him, but now I ſee, that though a mother may forget her ſucking childe, yet he cannot forget me. It cannot but expati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, in rebuking its owne heart, for unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workings againſt this God, whoſe love it now feeleth; it taketh Gods part againſt it ſelfe more then ever. <hi>Job</hi> 42. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>Now mine eye ſeeth thee, wherfore I abhorre my ſelfe</hi>— The cleareſt ſights of God, cauſe the greateſt ſelfe-abhorrency. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 61. <hi>Then ſhalt thou remember thy wayes, and be aſhamed</hi>— When? <hi>v.</hi> 60. <hi>When I ſhall eſtabliſh unto thee an everlaſting Covenant;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 63. <hi>When I am pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified towards thee</hi>— That teſtimonie which blocketh up the way to ſelfe-deteſtation, is very ſuſpicious, though it tranſporteth with joy and comfort; for the Lord hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that a ſight of pacification ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Evangelicall humiliation.</p>
                     <p>A deluſion hath a naturall tendency to the puffing up of the ſoule, and though hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites may have a ſhaddow of humilitie at other times, yet there is the leaſt appearance of it, under high attainements, and a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:119891:86"/>of glorious revelations. But Divine te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies are of Correctine uſe unto a ſoule. A <hi>Peter</hi> after a love-looke from Chriſt, O how he figheth, ſobbeth, melteth, mourneth, at the remembrance of a foregoing denyall of him. A <hi>Thomas,</hi> that hath riſen high, even unto redoubled actings of unbeliefe, when he hath thus ſeen, and felt too, O he cannot but check himſelfe, and ſay, <hi>My Lord, and my God,</hi> Joh. 20.28. Under ſuch heart-raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revelations, this pierceth, woundeth, and as it were ſtabbeth the ſoule; that the Lord hath had ſuch unſutable returnes from it, after ſo large expreſſions of his love.</p>

                        <hi>Evid.</hi> 4. The witneſſings of the Spirit, lay powerfull engagements upon the heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſelfe-purification: though ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſometimes lieth ſo darke that a ſoule may not be able to make uſe of that as a witnes for the preſent, yet ever in witneſſing, the Spirit layeth obligations upon the ſoule to ſeeke after it to its utmoſt for the future. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. Not onely ſome men, but <hi>[every man] that hath [this hope]. i. e.</hi> of ſeing God as he is. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>[purifieth himſelfe].</hi> And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purity or holines will not ſatisfie: A knowledge of Adoption, as, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. putteth it upon preſſing after the perfection of it, to be pure [<hi>as he,</hi> i. e. <hi>as God is pure</hi>] Whereas Deluſions tend ſome way or other to unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:119891:87"/>Satan driveth at ſome corrupt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fignes therein.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Evid.</hi> 5. The witneſſings of the Spirit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an expulſion of Satan out of the ſoule: Chriſt evinceth his being no impoſtour, and that he acted by the Spirit of God, becauſe he did caſt out Satan. <hi>Math.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26.28. So, if a teſtimonie of Adoption, conduceth to the ejection of Satan, out of the ſoule in his temptations, ſuggeſtions, &amp;c. this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to be no deluſion; for, if Satan ſhould caſt out Satan his kingdome were divided, and could not ſtand. <hi>v.</hi> 26. The binding of the ſtrong man armed muſt be by the Spirit, for none elſe is ſtronger then he. When the word abideth in a ſoule, then it <hi>overcometh the wicked one.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.14. Every manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, is for this end, to deſtroy the workes of the Devil. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8.</p>
                     <p>Deluſions dimme and dazle the eyes of the ſoule, that it cannot ſee into the craftie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances of that ſubtile adverſary. But the Spirit taketh off thoſe vailes that were upon the heart, and giveth notable diſcoveries of Satans cloſe plottings, croſſe actings, ſecret undermineings, ſoule-enſnaring ſtratagems, that it ſeeth into his wayes and methods more then ever. 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 7. Yea, it filleth the ſoule with dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of, and indignation againſt him, in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:119891:87"/>his enterpriſes, and that becauſe they tend to interrupt ſome deſignes of Chriſt, and to contradict his ends. <hi>Math.</hi> 3.17. with 4. <hi>v.</hi> 10. And alſo, many temptations are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come hereby, Satan will be incenſed, when he ſeeth himſelfe caſt out, and ſo, floods of new temptations are to be expected. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 13.15.</p>
                     <p>But, by the witneſſings of the Spirit uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a ſoule obtaineth a releaſe from thoſe old ones that it hath grapled with, and groaned, yea even ſunk under, many a day. And, it ſpeaketh the Spirit to be the author of a teſtimonie, when it worketh this way: for, Satan is not caſt out, but entreth into the ſoule when deluſions prevaile: and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is expelled out of the ſoule, when that is out of love with him, and when his wayes are rendred odious and abominable to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Evid.</hi> 6. Satan uſeth his utmoſt endeavours, to draw and beate off the ſoule from, and cauſe it to doubt of the Spirits teſtimonie; but he ſeeketh to prevent a queſtioning of his owne. I doe not make doubting an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Aſſurance; but, if thou can'ſt be ſure that Satan tempteth thee to doubting, and ſeeketh to divide between thee and a promiſe applyed; that argueth thy cloſure with the promiſe, not to be by his meanes. And, if thou be'ſt ſure that he perſwadeth
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:119891:88"/>thee to owne a teſtimonie ſtill, which thou baſt received, then it is very ſuſpicious. For, Satan is no ſuch friend or favourite unto the Spirit or its teſtimonie, as to ſeeke the hindring its queſtioning thereof. Neither is he ſuch an enemie to himſelfe, as to beate off from hearkening unto his owne deluſions, when the ſoule is enclined to imbrace them.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. From clear Scriptures. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 12.15. <hi>The Spirituall man judgeth all things—E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 61. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25. <hi>And thus are the ſecrets of his heart made manifeſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. From Experience: Chriſtians that at ſome times (through temptation) are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to deny ſuch diſpenſations of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; yet at other times can make large narrations of many paſſages they have met withall. They can declare how and in what manner the Word hath wrought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:119891:92"/>them: and yet ſuch ſoules under miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble queſtionings of their intereſt in Chriſt ſtill. It is out of doubt with them, and they are beyond queſtioning, whither they have been under ſuch workings or no; but here they ſticke, they know not wither theſe be witneſſings or not.</p>
                     <p>Beware therefore of harbouring any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, that either the deceitfulneſſe of thy own heart, or the counterfeit workings of Satan, ſhould render it impoſſible for thee to attaine a knowledge of thy owne heart, or of what workes have paſſed upon that. This conceit (raiſed by Satan) keepeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſoule on this ſide Aſſurance a great while.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The works that have paſſed upon thy heart being diſcerned, thou mayeſt examine and meaſure them by the written word whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be ſpeciall or common: if thou be'ſt ready to doubt and queſtion whither theſe be ſufficient to teſtifie adoption or not, by renewed recourſes to the Word, thou mayeſt finde what they are: whether they be ſuch as that calleth graces or not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is ſaid of the Chymicks that they will ſo counterfeit gold, that no touch-ſtone can diſcover it: Satan hath a great deale of Chymiſtry, he hath many things like graces, as faith, hope, humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are not
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:119891:93"/>thoſe graces; and therefore it behoveth the moſt confident ſoules often to try their grounds, and here is a touchſtone the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word that will never faile; this will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his moſt gliſtring counterfeit coyne.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A knowledge or reall diſcerning that thoſe ſpeciall workes have paſſed upon the heart is enough to render infallibly aſſured of the Spirits witneſſing: or may give a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that a right judgement is paſſed upon the condition. You may undoubtedly know, that it is the Spirit which witneſſeth, if you can clearly ſee, know or finde, that thoſe workes are wrought in your hearts, which are warranted in the written word to be witneſſing: for, the Spirit onely can create them there; and hence they are called <hi>fruits of the ſpirit,</hi> Gal. 5.22. This is a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing thing to many a Saint; could it but ſee that the Spirit were the author of a work, that it hath been under, then it could conclude of its Adoption from it: whereas, there are common workes of the Spirit, which a <hi>Saul,</hi> a <hi>Judas,</hi> a reprobate may have; and therefore barely the proceeding from the Spirit is not enough. But, it is neceſſary to know that the work thou haſt experience of, is a teſtimony, as well as, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is the agent. There are many workes of the Spirit, which cannot be denominated te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:119891:93"/>of Adoption. Now for the Spirit to bear witneſſe, plainly importeth theſe two things. 1. The giving of [a teſtimony] 2. That the Spirit is the giver of it. If thou beſt wrought into a perſwaſion of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the application of a word, there is a teſtimony; and if thou can'ſt finde that the Spirit hath raiſed this, that is ſufficient. And, if blood be ſo applyed as it is warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be a witnes; and ſo for Water, then the knowledge that they come, from the Spirit, (with that) is evidencing.</p>
                     <p>When works are of ſuch a nature as they doe witneſs adoption it was my ſcope and drift to diſcover in the foregoing Queſtions. In thoſe I have endeavoured to difference the ſpeciall workes of the Spirit from thoſe counterfeit works whereby Satan and mens own treachourous hearts do prevaile to the deceiving of them.</p>
                     <p>As the Spirit doth evidence its owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the immediate way of witneſſing; ſo, the ſpeciall nature and Qualitie of the workes themſelves may aſcertaine thee that they come from the Spirit, in the teſtimony of Water and Blood. If thou can'ſt deſcry thoſe operations within thy ſelfe, they may aſſure thee that the Spirit is their Author, and that thy heart hath not deceived thee, in thy Concluſions about thy Adoption;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:119891:94"/>and hence, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that beleiveth hath the witneſſe within himſelfe.</hi> Some might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, How ſhall we know that the Spirit and none elſe is the Witnes to us? the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle anſwereth <hi>[He that beleiveth—]</hi> belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving doth evidence the inhabitation of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>If the grounds of thy judgement be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, then the act of thy judgement muſt needs be infallible: that is true or falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the truth or falſeneſſe of the grounds. The act cannot be tryed without another act of judgement, &amp; ſo there would be no end, and then certainty were unattain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, if the act were to be tryed: for, ſo long as there is any tryall there is an act of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſed. If thou findeſt, 1. That ſome works have paſſed upon thy heart. 2. That they are ſuch as are warranted to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing, the act of judgment is unqueſtionable. From thy [diſcerning] them, thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conclude, that thou haſt the irradiations of the ſpirit, for none but the Spirit can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover theſe. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11, 12. From [the works diſcerned] thou mayeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the preſence of the ſpirit, and thy own Adoption.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If thou be'ſt in the darke, or wanteſt clearneſs about the works themſelves which formerly thy ſoule hath been under, thou
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:119891:94"/>art ever to beware at ſuch a time, of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Concluſions about thy condition: many have been ready to deny the grace of Chriſt, and have run their ſoules upon hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible temptations, and into deep deſertions, and have given Satan great advantages to ruſh them into unbeleife, by concluding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſight of halfe-works, or without a clearneſs in the nature, quality, circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ends of what they have met withall. When the eyes of thy ſoule are dim (as in a day of deſertion) thou art not a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent judge, but oughteſt to attend unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duties, that concerne thee in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition, and to waite for the ſhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit upon the works thou haſt had experience of; and if ſuch a candle be lighted up in thy ſoule as enableth thee to ſee, and by the word to diſcerne them to be ſpeciall workes, then thou mayeſt ſay, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1. <hi>My conſcience beareth me witneſs by the Holy-ghoſt—</hi> and then it is dangerous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming or diſowning the Spirit in its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is the worke of the Spirit to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver both the ſincerity and the deceitfulneſſe of the heart: there are ſeeds of hypocrifie as well as of other ſins even in the beſt of Saints. They finde matter for heart-breaking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the treacherouſneſſe of their own
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:119891:95"/>hearts. Grace doth not tot ally deſtroy the being of any one ſin. <hi>Peters</hi> heart deceived him, when he was upon high reſolves for Chriſt, and yet a beleever. But never doth a ſoule ſee more of the deceitfulneſſe of its heart, then upon a diſcovery of divine love, <hi>Job</hi> 42.5, 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.63.</p>
                     <p>And thus, he that would not be deceived, ſhall not be left to the deceitfulneſſe of his own heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But I have found that my heart hath deceived me, and I was miſtaken in my paſſing a judgement about other matters, and I had as many ſymptomes of my being led by the Spirit of God into thoſe Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as I have of its leading me into this; and therefore I fear I am deceived in all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Thou mighteſt be deceived about ſome Circumſtance, and the particular end of ſome diſpenſation, and yet thy judgment might be right in the maine.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Particular miſtakes are not to be made generall rules: <hi>Peter</hi> had a clear teſtimony of his Adoption, and that from the mouth of Chriſt himſelf. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Bleſſed art thou Simon—</hi> and yet this did not preſerve him from a deluſion of Satan that came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23. The ſame mouth that bleſſed him, quickly called him <hi>Satan.</hi> Chriſts teſtimony was enough to give him full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:119891:95"/>of Divine love; but yet it did not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him againſt a falſe Confidence in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Caſe, nor a dolefull fall. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>v.</hi> 35.70.72.</p>
                     <p>It thy heart hath deceived thee in ſome particular things, yet do not Conclude that thou art deluded in all.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Yet let thy miſtakes provoke thee to the greater watchfulnes againſt the deluſions of Satan, and thy own Spirit.</p>
                     <p>And take theſe as Symptomes of deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and beware of yeelding to them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Whatſoever hath a naturall tendency to promote ſin or unrighteouſneſſe, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion: unholines cannot be from the holy Spirit; and hence there is a diametrical op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition between the fruits of the Spirit, and the workes of the fleſh. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20.22. that which emboldneth, or giveth any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, or is refreſhing to corruption, beware of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p n="3">3. That which ſpringeth from a ſuppoſed ſelfe-ſufficiency, or in its owne nature lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into ſelfe-advancement, is a Deluſion. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.6. <hi>David</hi> was confident he ſhould not be moved, and this was built and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed upon his outward accommodations and furniſhments for ſelf-defence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he checketh, correcteth, and recalleth himſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>By thy favour my mountaine ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſtrong.</hi> So, if thou haſt overcome this or that temptation, and now Concludeſt that thou art able to encounter with any, it is but the voyce of thy own Spirit, and it may be a ſmall one will ſurprize thee quickly.

                     <p>Chriſt warmed the hearts of his Diſciples in his talking with them, and expounding the Scriptures to them; but yet they knew not that it was his voyce, untill they came up to ſome other duties, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 29, 30, 31, 32.</p>

It is thy duty to beleeve on Chriſt whatever thy condition be: if thou haſt not committed the unpardonable ſin, thou can'ſt not tell but that thou mayeſt finde mercy.

Trouble and perplex not thy ſoule ſo much, about that queſtion, whither thou haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved or not; but, put it out of doubt by a freſh act of faith.</p>
                     <p>A repetition of acts of faith, is very ſutable to a Saint in his darkeſt Condition. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 50.10. <hi>He that walketh in ſuch darknes that be hath no light, is injoyned then to truſt in the Name of God.</hi>

                     <p>If particular promiſes faile, or be out of ſight, and ſenſible experiences faile, that it be a midnight of darkneſſe with the ſoule, yet there is the Name of God to run to, and truſt in ſtill: what his Name is, ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>The Lord God, mercifull, gracious, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, abundant in goodnes and truth, forgiving iniquity, and tranſgreſſion and ſin</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>I would not have a ſoule upon ſlighty grounds caſt away all former experiences; but, if Egyptian darknes ſeemeth to cover it, the beſt way to recover all againe, is by a new act of faith. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.3. <hi>What time I am afraid, I will truſt in thee.</hi> When it is afraid of unſoundnes of heart, then it ought to truſt in God, as well as under other feares.</p>

But uſually in ſuch Caſes, the Lord giveth clearnes about what is duty, before he blocketh up the way to it; yea, and holdeth up the heart to it, in the midſt of ſuch diſcouragements: this woman was the more importunate, the more repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſeeming denyals ſhe had from Chriſt.

It is thy duty to live a life of-faith, when thou wanteſt feeling. Chriſt was without feeling when he cryed out <hi>[Why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?]</hi> and yet not without a faith of Aſſurance, for he ſaith <hi>[my God, my God.]</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. <hi>v.</hi> 34, 35, 36.

                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:119891:103"/>
                     <p n="1">1. Some ſpirituall Conſiderations, ſeen to ariſe from the Word, may be made uſe of as well as expreſſe Scriptures: if thou haſt a temptation that thou can'ſt not finde any expreſſe Scripture to helpe thee againſt it, yet ſome Scripturall Conſideration may be beneficiall towards thy reliefe and ſoule-eſtabliſhment. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. He was tempted by the proſperity of the wicked, and the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Sainte, to ſay, <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Verily have cleanſed my heart in vaine</hi>—and he was at a great loſſe, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17. <hi>When I thought to know this, it was too painfull for me: untill I went into the Sanctuary.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This ſpirituall conſideration kept it from prevailing. <hi>viz.</hi> That if he ſhould affirme it, he muſt ſay that the Lord never had a people on Earth; for <hi>Adam, Noah, Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and all the Sonnes of God that ever were, have been exerciſed with afflictions and croſſes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That which is agreeable to the drift and conſonant to the minde of God, or his maine end in any Scripture, it to he owned as of God, though not contained in expreſſe words in Scripture.</p>

                     <p>A Chriſtian is apt to be ſtumbled, when ſome part of a Scripture (though of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and entire ſence) be caſt in, if there be a variation in ſome termes from the words of Scripture, and hereupon he is ready to reject it, and to reckon it not from God. Whereas, if it beareth the ſence, of ſome one place, or hath the drift of the Lord in it, thou oughteſt to improve it, if ſutable to thy Condition: elſe all interpretations of the word were uſeles. <hi>Math.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 9.

                     <p n="3">3. A Scripture made uſe of in one condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may have much deducible from it, that may be ſuccouring to a ſoule in another condition: or that which is uſed upon one occaſion, may be uſefull on another occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Math.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>It is written, thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord</hi>—</p>

Whereas, if the word which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in, doth evidence this to be duty at this time, or in this Condition; then, they have cauſe to bleſſe the Lord for the bringing to remembrance, a word which is of Directive uſe to them.

                     <p>A beleever ſhould thinke thus with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; Surely it is of great concernment to me to improve this word, Leſſer providences ought to be followed up towards Goſpell ends, but greater much more; and therefore it ſtandeth me in hand to looke about me, that theſe remarkable ones paſſe not away without attaining ſome ſpeciall ends. And, if the word be improved for the ends it aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at, as Quickening, ſupportment, the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome graces &amp;c. Theſe improvements of it are witneſſing. But if theſe be neglected, the ends of the Spirit in caſting it in, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attained, and ſo the Concluſions drawne from it are ungrounded.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Prophet <hi>David</hi> aſcribed all ſuch effects to the word it ſelfe: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>v.</hi> 24.50.105.133. It was the word that Directed, Counſelled, Quickened, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted him. Doubtles there was an applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Word, elſe it would not have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed theſe ends. But Application de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth the Conveyance of the word into the heart, and its implantation, ingrafting, and working mightily there; which is ſarre more then, a hinting of it in, or the bringing it to minde; and yet, he reſolveth all, into the word it ſelfe applyed, rather then into the application.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Becauſe of the inconveniencies, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:119891:106"/>dangerous conſequences that uſually attend building concluſions about its duty or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition upon the bare hinting in of words: as, hence a foule is often ready to reject a word ſutable to its condition, which if own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might be of great advantage to it. O (ſaith the ſoule) I know not whither it onely came to my remembrance by often read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, or were given in by the Spirit. Whereas thou oughteſt to have familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 7. and it is thy mercy, if thy mind be filled with variety of words ſutable to the ſeverall, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igencies, neceſſities, and temptations, thou meeteſt withall. Their being familiarized to thee, ſhould be ſo far from occaſioning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, that it ought to be reckoned thy great mercy that thou haſt them at hand; when many are much at a loſſe, for want of ſutable words to their conditions. But know that the Lord hath bundled up the Promiſes in the word, that upon all occaſions thou mighteſt have recourſe to him by them, for what thou wanteſt: and ſo thou ſhouldeſt be ſo far from diſowning a ſutable word, when hinted in, that thou oughteſt to goe and take a word, when it is not given in. It is thy duty to ſearch the Scriptures when thou art at a loſſe about any matter, and to improve any word futable to thy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:119891:106"/>that thou findeſt, as well as if it were hinted in. <hi>John</hi> 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures.</hi> Acts 17. <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>
                     <p>Againe, ſome have perſiſted in the neglect of their duty a great while, for the want of the giving in of a word, and have loſt much Communion with God hereby. Others ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves miſtaken in their Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the hinting in of words, have been led into a queſtioning of all their other Experiences.</p>
                     <p>Therefore if a word ſutable to thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be given in, bleſſe the Lord for it: if not, find out one, and take it, whether it be a witneſſing, quickning, ſupporting or comforting word, and pray over it, yea give the Lord no reſt untill he hath made a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull application of thy heart, ſo as to draw that out after Chriſt by it: and without this improvement of it, for its proper end it pointeth at; the hinting of it in, will prove of but little advantage to ther, though by the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 Laſtly, Hold faſt the Doctrine of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance: The Lord hath promiſed that he will put his fear in their hearts that he ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the everlaſting Covenant, that they ſhall not depart from him. <hi>Jere.</hi> 32. <hi>v.</hi> 40.

                  <p>They are the Epiſtle of Chriſt, and have his will written by the finger of the Spirit on their inward man.</p>
                  <p>There is much entercourſe and communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ and them, and many ſweet puſſages, which carnall hearts know not of. There are many outgoings of their Joules towards Chriſt, and incomings of Chriſt into their ſoules, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are unacquainted with. Theſe are called Experiences.</p>
                  <p>It ſeemeth to be one work of this Generation to declare Gods works.</p>
                  <p>Many opportunities and advantages are afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the drawing out Experiences, which for many years have been denyed.</p>
                  <p>When I firſt ſet about this worke, I aimed to have the greateſt part of this Treatiſe made up of Experiences; and only to uſher them in with a ſhort preparatory of my owne: but contrary to my intendments, and ſomething to my affliction, my
<pb facs="tcp:119891:109"/>owne diſcourſe hath ſo ſwelled in my hands, that it doth crowd theſe Experiences into a little cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And Reader, take notice, that they are the Experiences of other Chriſtian friends, not mine owne, that are here offered to thy view. Their ſincerity, and uprightnes (whoſe they are) is declared to thoſe that are round about them, by their holy, humble, and Goſpel converſation: ſo that, I durſt not but think, that thou haſt here, what God hath ſealed and delivered to them.</p>
                  <p>If any ſhould ſtumble at the publiſhing Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and judge it unmeet, eſpecially becauſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men may make an ill uſe of them: I ſhall deſire ſuch to conſider a few Scriptures, <hi>Pſal. 66.16.

Then will I teach tranſgreſſours [thy wayes]</hi> i. e. not onely as revealed in the word, but <hi>[thy ways]</hi> by thy word in my heart, in purging me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and what ſhall be the iſſue of it? <hi>[And Sinners ſhall be converted to thee.]</hi> So that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring of Experiences, is one means which we may expect the Lord will make ſucces full unto the converſion of ſinners. And indeed the Book of the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> is preſented to the eyes of men, both good and bad, and doth conſiſt for the moſt part of Experiences.</p>

                     <p>I had longing deſires after further injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſt, and was much in the uſe of meanes for that end: and once, going over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night to heare M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>S.</hi> preach, I was taken up with many troubled thoughts, and in the night I could not take any reſt; yet, my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was much refreſhed before the morning.

                     <p>Some time after this the Lord afforded me, a marvellous revelation of himſelfe, on this manner.</p>

                     <p>My memory will not admit, to diſcover what I met withall this way. As, <hi>When a mans wayes are pleaſing to the Lord, his enemies ſhall be at peace with him.</hi>

When they perſecute, yet in their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they ſhall Juſtifie. Their being at peace was, in regard of their Conſciences; not that they ſhould be at peace, as men contrary: but, though through the vilenes of Nature, they have malice againſt you; yet, in their Conſciences they ſhall juſtifie and acquite you, and fall downe and ſay, <hi>God is in you of a truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. <hi>He that is ſpirituall judgeth all things, yet he himſelfe is judged of no man. i. e.</hi> The Lord giveth him a judgement of all things in himſelfe; and he can judge what is of the Spirit, and what is not: and another cannot judge him about his having a Spirit of judgement given him.</p>
                     <p>And it was brought in, that it was the ſame Spirit I now felt, that Spirit that did write the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>And it was brought to minde thus: theſe are the things that thy heart did glow and pant after, though underſtandingly thou did ſh?ot expreſſe it.</p>
                     <p>I was heretofore in a ſad condition, my life was a life of begging, when ſhould I praiſe the Lord, I begged for underſtanding in the myſterie of the Covenant, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119891:113"/>this was brought in, that this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all underſtanding which the Lord did give me into the Scriptures, this was that I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, it was an anſwer of theſe things.</p>
                     <p>And by the temptation that did follow, this is that thou did'ſt pray for &amp;c. I did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it was given in ſo. Many other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were brought in, which I cannot recall. After in the day I had ſomething of what I thus injoyed in the night; and I would then have recollected, and have conſidered what it was, but I could not; my heart fainted, and preſently I fell into a cold ſweat. I could not review or recollect for a Quarter of a yeare.</p>
                     <p>It pleaſed the Lord to bring to minde ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall diſcoveries to the Apoſtles, in what manner the Lord did reveale himſelfe to them,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Job.</hi> 33.15, 16. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 32.3, 4.</note> and concerning <hi>Job; And the eyes of them that ſee ſhall not be dimme—And the tongue of him that ſtammereth ſhall be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſpeake plainly.</hi> Such Scriptures were brought to mind, with the meaning of them, and accordingly that I ſhould ſpeake plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that I ſhould clearly underſtand the Spirits working, from every other thing, that it was from God.</p>
                     <p>And for the Certainty of it, I did ſee, and could not doubt of it, that the very admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration was given to me, which was given
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119891:113"/>to the Apoſtles and Saints of old. Yet it was rather committed ſtill, to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, then to my affection. Another night againe waking, I had other Scriptures in the new Teſtament opened to me, in the ſame manner as before. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 11.21.23. I underſtood that, to be one with Chriſt, was, to have our will melted into the will of Chriſt, and it was that I now felt, and I did ſee the thing to be of infinite glory, to have our hearts melted into the glory of God.</p>
                     <p>Another was, <hi>Math</hi> 26. <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>I will not drinke henceforth of the fruit of the Vine, untill that day, when I drinke it new with you in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers kingdome.</hi> The wine is that Comfort, and wonderfull refreſhment which is injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and that which I had was a ſymptome and taſt of that wine, that I ſhould ever drink in the kingdome of heaven, and it was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull for the preſent.</p>
                     <p>This was in the night, in the day againe, I went on in feare &amp; aſtoniſhment; I thought in the morning what it ſhould be, and the end of it. I conſidered whither it were the powring out of the Spirit, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaketh of, and I could not tell what it ſhould be, I could never pray for it diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo I had it not in that way, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what my heart could conceive of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hid it, and ſo I could not pray for it.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119891:114"/>This againe put me into melancholy, and my heart fainted; yet I was not able to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, for the probation or tryall of what I mett withall, whence it came &amp;c. Onely the Lord did diſcover to me, ſome of his ends in theſe things.</p>
                     <p>Now I had feares that I ſhould never be fitt for my Calling againe, and there was no agreeablenes or ſutablenes between me and any Creature. But, though my Spirit was full of trouble, yet I had a ſtaying thought, that the Lord would fit me for my calling, or let me die.</p>
                     <p>That word was caſt in, <hi>Math.</hi> 9.17. <hi>Men doe not put new wine into old bottles, elſe the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles breake</hi>— I ſee it was becauſe of the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of my veſſell, that I was under ſuch fears; but the Lord aſſured me that he would beare me up, to the thing that he ſhould declare unto me, and make me able to beare his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightenings, and he did bid me be of good cheere.</p>
                     <p>Another night I had many hard places of Scripture, very ſpiritually declared unto me. In the day againe I was troubled, and had a kinde of weaknes and dread on my Spirit. But, one time I did willingly take a little contentment in the creature; and there came a terrour, that I went about to reſiſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and aſtoniſhment came, and I reſolved
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119891:114"/>that I would take heed of yeelding to any ſuch thing any more, and that I would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto what ſhould be given in.</p>
                     <p>In the Concluding of all,<note place="margin">The witneſſing of Adoption by the Spirit.</note> it was brought in to me thus: What thou haſt ſeen and beheld it was the Lord, and God juſtifying of thee, thou haſt ſeen his infinite and invincible power; thy heart hath been kept up, and it is made ſure to thee that it was the Lord, thou knoweſt it was he and none elſe, it was irreſiſtible.</p>
                     <p>Now it is done, I have ſealed thee up to the day of redemption, and cauſed thee to ſet to thy ſeale, that I am true, thou knoweſt it was God, and haſt ſealed to it. Now, goe forth into thy Calling, and attend upon it, keep thy minde intent upon it, and ſee thou deſt not diſhonour me. And I did ſo, and found ſome ſtirrings of corruption, &amp; temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation aſſaulting, which I did not before, onely feare and dread.</p>
                     <p>Now the hardſhip came that day; I had as hard a day of it, as ever in my life; then Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſet on me with violent temptations, and I was darke, this miniſtration withdrawne, I had it no more that day, and my heart was ſad.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tempta.</hi> 1. I was tempted that now my earthen veſſell ſhould be broken, and I ſhould be diſtracted &amp;c. and I had brought it upon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119891:115"/>my ſelfe; and thus brought it, becauſe I had ſought of God that he would reveale the Covenant of grace to me, and teach me &amp;c. and in the former miniſtration it was given in, this is that thy ſoule deſired.</p>
                     <p>Some buſines was to be done and I did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get; and it came upon me, do'ſt thou not ſee, thou haſt loſt the uſe of reaſon; had'ſt not better have been in a low condition? <hi>But you would be taught of God</hi>—And</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I was much affrighted that day and full of feares.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. My heart was ſo darke that I could not reaſon the caſe with Satan; for, then I might have told him he was a liar: for, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired underſtanding in the myſtery of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that my heart might goe in a right way to Chriſt. But, I could not reflect but wholly attend to Satan. And Satan gave me Impulſions to goe read, and try to pray, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting to me, thou haſt nothing to pray, thou haſt ſeen God, and needeſt not faith &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Yet I kept this all alongſt, that God was my Father; and though I was diſtreſſed, yet not in the leaſt teares of periſhing. Satan could never ſhoote one arrow, to make me thinke it was not of God. And in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration it was given in, that ſin was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded out, that it might not be mingled with his worke, and no battery ever ſhould
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119891:115"/>be made againſt it. I knew I was ſafe for eternity.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Yet I conſidered with my ſelfe, had it not been for me to have dyed, and was ready to ſay with <hi>Peter; Depart from me,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke</hi> 5.8.</note> 
                        <hi>for I am a ſinfull creature,</hi> it was a ſorrow to my ſoule that I had ſo much, becauſe I knew not how to behave my ſelfe under it. I entreated the Lord to ſhew me Jeſus, that was fitteſt for a mortall creature to looke upon; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently I fell into a mighty trembling: but immediately recovered my ſelfe thus <hi>[the will of the Lord be done]</hi> and was quieted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as to that.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Lords day approaching, ſome of the family wiſhed me to goe out to heare; and I deſired every Ordinance; but by the tediouſneſſe of the weather I was then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented? and being at home in this darke condition all alone; I reſolved to ſet upon duty, yet had no matter, but to ſpread my miſery before the Lord.</p>
                     <p>I did excuſe my ſelfe thus, Lord thou haſt been a wonder-working God in my ſoule, I entreate thee teach me, and ſhew me Jeſus in whom I have beleeved. Thou haſt troden the wine-preſſe alone, and that for me; thou haſt freely layd downe thy life, and that for me; thou haſt promiſed that thoſe which keep the word of thy patience, thou wilt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119891:116"/>keep them in the houre of temptation. Lord thou knoweſt this is the houre of my temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, I have neither faith, nor feeling. As thou haſt made me paſſive in injoying, ſo now make me paſſive in beleeving. And I reherſed theſe words three times, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee, the Lord rebuke thee, the Lord rebuke thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6.<note place="margin">Chriſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring in temptation.</note> I found immediately an invincible power bearing up my heart, to caſt helpe upon one that is mighty, Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo evidently and certainly, that one ſhould ſooner perſwade me, that a man which I ſee and have conference with, is not a man, then that I did not ſee Chriſt by faith. I did ſee my ſelfe taken, as out of the Lyons den; and my heart triumphing in Chriſt, that from this houre I could read, and pray, without trouble, and feed upon Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>I had another miniſtration in the night, diſcovering the difference between legal ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and Goſpel ſorrow, and I was put into a condition fit to beare it, and my heart was melted into that Goſpel ſorrow: but I am not able to declare particularly how it was with me here, for a world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tempta.</hi> 2. After this Satan did aſſault me very ſtrongly with this temptation, that I did Idolize the Scriptures. From the firſt of theſe diſcoveries, was taken with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe all was conveyed by them to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119891:116"/>me. I received it that the Scriptures were the word of God, from what I had ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but now I knew it from the certainty of the Spirit, and its making my heart one with the Scriptures; and now it was ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that I made an Idoll of them; and upon that I fell into a mighty trembling and feare, for it came very ſuddenly.</p>
                     <p>In a little ſpace I had ſweet refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and diſtillations of the Spirit,<note place="margin">Helpe againſt temptation.</note> that came in thus.</p>
                     <p>Not the letter, but the Spirit that wrote the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>And my heart was quieted againe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tempta.</hi> 3. Another came, that I did Idolize the Son of God, for I was afraid of God, and was taken up in beleeving on Jeſus. I was trembling and in a ſweat, and a great hurry upon this. And O had it not been better that I had died! and I feared I ſhould never be rid of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> After a little ſpace it was given in, that the Father, Son, and Spirit, is one pure Eſſence, and Chriſt <hi>being in the forme of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6.</note> 
                        <hi>thought it not robbery to be equall with God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, <hi>the Word was made fleſh, and was with God, and was God.</hi> And the Son of God aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our nature, became a fit Mediatour for the ſoule to come to God by; and he is to be honoured as God: and that temptation went
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119891:117"/>away, and I had not any of the like nature, after. But I was tempted to doubt of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the body, and what ſhould be enjoyed hereafter, and I was put upon it to prove whither Chriſt was in heaven in his humane nature, and for the preſent I had not the Scriptures at hand, nor could not finde wherewithall to anſwer them: but, it pleaſed the Lord to ſtay my heart up with this; that he was my Father, and I ſhould be quiet with what he would provide. It doth not become Children to enquire what riches or inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhall be given, it is enough that God is their Father: and this was till I had Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to helpe me.</p>
                     <p>And one Scripture that did refreſh me was, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 23.24. <hi>The houre is come that the Son of man ſhould be glorified; verily, verily I ſay unto you, except a corne of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</hi> By that I did ſee that Chriſt was the graine, caſt under the clod, &amp; being ſowne, bringeth up more with him; and ſo I did ſee the reſurrection of the body, in the reſurrection of Chriſt. And concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, I had reliefe from that Scripture <hi>[The man Chriſt Jeſus].</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as the Scripture was brought in, I did ſee Satan continually throwne out, by the Word of God.</p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:119891:117"/>
                     <p>Now, Concerning the Effects of it, how I have continued for two or three yeares ſince, I can give it thus.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I have found my life wonderfully ſweet over ever before; in a ſtated, ſetled conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from my union with Chriſt; that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I want or whatever condition I be in, I can goe to him freely as to a Father.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whatſoever my faith is kept up hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Chriſt for, in a way of prayer; I have it given in or granted.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When faith doth not act, then my ſoule is in a condition as without life; but if I can feed on Chriſt, and by freſh acts relie on him, I can ſit downe under his ſhaddow with great delight.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Yet, I know I have a body of ſin, and I finde much weaknes in my ſelfe; but my life is not made uncomfortable hereby; becauſe I have recourſe to Chriſt that is my ſhield, and have him made over to me.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Yet I have ſtreights and wonderfull feares for a little time: ſuch things are dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in, if I ſhould looſe the preſence of God what would become of me, it would be worſe then ever; and am troubled that I ſhould be inordinate in deſiring the joy of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In all theſe things, Chriſt is helping of me, in every conflict; that though I deſire
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119891:118"/>to follow him in every ordinance; yet, to the praiſe of his grace be it ſpoken, I have a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to goe to, and one to bring me out of every ſuch condition, and I have immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately a ſupply given in, and in this grace I now ſtand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tempta.</hi> I was once ſince in a mighty feare from hence, how if I ſhould ſin, what ſhould become of me then? <hi>and I ſhall one day fall by the hand of Saul;</hi> though not to looſe my ſoule, yet to looſe this preſence of Chriſt by ſome ſin or other. This was my temptation.</p>
                     <p>That night I was ſad, and on my firſt wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my heart was in a kinde of heate, or wonderfull glowing, and this preſented to me, in a way of enlightening <hi>[I am wounded, I am wounded]</hi> And upon the enlightening I fell into weeping. I conſidered what it was, and the very thing did fill my heart with ſorrow, and joy; and I conſidered that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall looke upon him whom they have pierced and mourne:</hi> and <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.6. <hi>One ſhall ſay, what are theſe wounds? and he ſhall anſwer, thoſe with which I was wounded in the houſe of my friend.</hi> Upon this there was a cleare enlightening that I knew this was the heart of Chriſt rowling towards ſinners, God juſtifying and Chriſt dying, and he was wounded by me in a way of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning his continuance with me, yet he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119891:118"/>me his friend; <hi>and thus he was wounded in the houſe of his friend.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I knew not where the Scripture was at firſt, but was certaine that it was ſpoken of Chriſt, and the heate of ſpirit did continue with me, till I found the Scripture.</p>
                     <p>I ſearched and at laſt found it, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the meaning of the Chapter, and ſaw it muſt be meant of Chriſt, and ſo I found that it was the voyce of Chriſt to my ſoule. And my life ſtill is ſweet, how long it will be ſo I know not; but I know, he that hath kept, may keep ſtill. And though I be vile, and the leaſt of all Saints, when in this ſenſe of my weaknes, I can looke on the free ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Chriſt, I am ſupported, becauſe all my fullnes, and riches is layd up in him. And ſince this condition, though I have pride and unbeliefe, and finde abundance, yet I have not found it ſo prevailing as before. It is rather in my members, then in my minde; my heart is broken off from the love of all ſin, and it is my greateſt affliction. And I finde Chriſt crucifying the fleſh in me, that I am not in every duty ſo bowed under as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but Chriſt maketh me a Conquerour over ſin and Satan dayly.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. I could not retaine thoſe enlightenings any longer then I had them; nor, when they were withdrawne was there the leaſt ability in me to recover them againe.</p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:119891:119"/>
                     <p n="8">8. I perceived that my aſtoniſhment did often ariſe from the coming in of things ſo ſuddenly: but, when I ſaw my condition was not contrary to Scripture, but agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it, then my heart was quieted. And under thoſe diſcoveries, if newes had come that I ſhould be torne in pieces, or met with fire and faggot, I could not have been ſenfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. In all theſe diſcoveries, I had nothing but came with this <hi>[As it is written]</hi> and ſo I did wonderfully eſteeme and value the Scriptures; and my heart was wonderfully ſet againſt thoſe that pretend to Revelations without, or not agreeable to or againſt the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. I found a reſolution to attend on Chriſt in all his appointments, and a ſutablenes in my Spirit to the meaneſt of them.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. There was drawne out a greater love to the Saints then ever.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. I had violent impulſions to declare it, and ſet a day apart to praiſe God: but, I found it was of Satan; The Lord perſwaded me thatit was onely concerning my ſelfe, and was witnes enough of it ſelfe, needed no proving; and I underſtood that as <hi>Mary. Luk.</hi> 2.19. I ſhould keep theſe things &amp; pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in my heart, and remember the ſtill voice, and take no care, the Lords glory is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119891:119"/>his owne, and he will vindicate it how he pleaſeth; and when he would have me ſpeak of it, he would fit me a ſeaſon to doe it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu:</hi> How doe you know that theſe things proceeded from the Divine Spirit, and were not Deluſions of Satan?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I know it was of God, by the evidence the Spirit did give of it ſelfe, in its owne teſtimonie.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. BEing in a great ſtreight, not knowing which way to get out, it pleaſed God to caſt my eye upon a promiſe which was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to my preſent ſtreight; yet did I not finde ſuch lively ſtrength in it, as to deliver me: but, I was enabled to lay my condition and the promiſe together, downe at the feet of the Lord, and found much quietnes of Spirit thereupon.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Being once troubled about the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of beleeving, I had ſuch a hint as this; that I ſhould view the promiſe. <hi>i. e.</hi> looke againe and againe, and venture upon it, it may be I ſhall not ſpeed, in obtaining that which the promiſe holdeth out to me; yet, however I will, as duty injoyneth me (it being the great Commandement to beleeve) put it to the tryall, and ſtay upon it, abide and continue to roule and repoſe the whole weight of all my wants upon the promiſe; and I ſaw plainly, that though I did ſo, yet I did miſcarry. As,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I looked at the matter of the promiſe, more then upon the promiſer: <hi>ex. gr.</hi> I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at comfort and deliverance that ſhould come in by the promiſe, more then at Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:119891:120"/>
                        <p n="2">2. I did come deſirous to obtaine what the promiſe held out, yet was not thankfull for what I had already received: as, in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>I will take away the ſtony heart, and give you an heart of fleſh.</hi> I came to the promiſe as one that had nothing at all of it; and it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord to ſuffer ſuch a frame of heart upon me, as I apprehended my heart was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſtony; hereby ſhewing me my evill; for, I ſhould have bleſſed God for any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſoftnes of heart, which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on me.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. I came to the promiſe in my owne ſtrength; I had this apprehenſion, as God hath given the promiſe, ſo the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe alſo, to apply it; and going to it, I ſhould as a poore, empty, nothing creature, look in the ſtrength of the Spirit to apply it. I have found that whil'ſt I have been belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, a quiet waiting, Gods time for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of promiſes, and not making ſuch haſt, as the unquietnes and over-eager haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of my Spirit hath put me upon at other times.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. I have had ſuch a ſight of God as to make the creature, and all its power, rage actings &amp;c. to be as nothing.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. I have been for a time as bold as a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and have not met with ſuch failings of heart as at other times.</p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:119891:121"/>
                        <p n="5">5. Hearing a Chriſtian in private, utter theſe words <hi>[faith worketh by love]</hi> I had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſweet apprehenſion that our faith eying the ſweet love of the Father, and the deare &amp; tender love of the Son, did gather ſtrength thence, and worke effectually by the ſtrength of that love.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Being brought to a great ſtand by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the actings of ſome corruptions in me, and almoſt beaten off from beleeving; that was brought to minde with comfort and encouragement to the worke of faith. <hi>Joſeph</hi> went and asked the body of Chriſt boldly: ſo, I ſhould venture by beleeving on a crucified Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. At another time being exceedingly low by reaſon of ſome corruptions breaking forth, I came into the ſociety of ſome godly people, and hearing one in prayer mention this concerning Chriſts Interceſſion [If there were one moment wherein the people of God were not preſented to the Father in the blood of Chriſt, it were very ſad with them]. I found faith recovering a little hence, as one that hath received a wound doth begin to recover out of the ſwouning fitt, it caſt him into.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Soone after my faith being as it were a bleeding and languiſhing, it was thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived <hi>[my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119891:121"/>my wayes your wayes]</hi> I had an extraordinary light into that Scripture at that time, which did ſet me a breathing after the Lord.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Being once through extraordinary buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetings of Satan, brought to ſuch extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that I fell into ſuch kinde of thoughts as theſe; were it not better for me to give over, and never minde any thing of God more? is it a duty for me to beleeve? ſhould I not be in great peace if I did at once caſt off all?</p>
                        <p>This came to relieve me; <hi>[If need be ye are in heavines for a moment — Now you have ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but I will ſee you againe and ye ſhall rejoyce, and your joy ſhall no man take from you.</hi> Thus was my faith a little revived againe.</p>
                        <p>The very next day I was more ſadly ſet upon then ever, and then this conſideration, <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved God upon the greatdſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages, and ſo gave glory to God, ſo ought I now, and hereby a way was made for my eſcape.</p>

                        <head>Concerning Temptation.</head>
                        <p>I being ſadly tempted, and finding Satan buffeting me violently, partly upbraiding me for former ſins, and partly putting me on to ſin, I was in great perplexity, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that I was conſtrained to cry out by reaſon of the bitternes of my ſoule, and alſo to call in the helpe of a Chriſtian friend to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119891:122"/>pray with me, he was much affected with my condition, himſelfe having been under ſuch temptations. I would have beleeved but could not; I would have put away thoughts of temptation but could not: the temptation grew ſtronger and ſtronger, my heart was broken by reaſon of ſorrow; yet for a time, marvellouſly kept up to ſtrive; I ſaw I could not hold out, and was ready to yeeld, and give over the combat. But, I found the Lord coming in for my helpe, in a needfull time, when I was without ſtrength. I apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the power of Chriſt very ſenſibly ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the power of the Devill, and he began to give ground. I had ſuſtained many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred charges concerning the odious nature of my ſinne, and the ſad curſe denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame. After a little retreate of the enemy, I began to take a little boldnes, but never with more trembling, and deſpairing in my ſelfe, or more cleaving to Chriſt as a Conquerour: I could then truely ſay, <hi>my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing is in another, and I have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> And

                              <item>1. I ſaw I conquered, yet triumphed in Chriſts Conqueſt.</item>
                              <item>2. Never could I ſo pittie thoſe that are tempted as then.</item>
                              <item>3. Never more ſenſible of ſpirituall ſins, then at this time: I apprehended it a great
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119891:122"/>evill for a poore wretch to cheriſh the pride of his heart, by wearing gay cloathes, &amp;c. O but how was this comparable to the ſin of priding ones ſelfe in the precious graces of the Spirit!</item>
                              <item>4. Whereas before it had been a great pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of Satan to turn mine eye from himſelfe and his actings to poore Inſtruments, vaſſals of his owne: now I could looke at himſelfe, and ſet my ſelfe in the ſirength of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</item>
                              <item>5. I could with an holy contempt, looke upon all the deſignes of Satan and of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.</item>
                              <item>6. I was exceedingly filled with the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God; eſpecially that he ſhould take ſuch an advantage of the Tempter, and make ſo good a Concluſion of ſo unhappy a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</item>
                              <item>7. I was much ſtirred up to make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the temptation, and that thus, by croſſing the Devils maine drift in the temptation, which was, to draw my ſoule into a greater diſtance from Chriſt; now I laboured to get and keep neerer to him.</item>
                              <item>8. I was fitted and prepared for ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſervice (even by the temptation) which was ſoone after to fall upon me.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>And I have obſerved theſe things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Temptations further.</p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:119891:123"/>
                        <p n="1">1. I have obſerved that when I have had largeſt diſcoveries of the grace of God in the Goſpell, when I have dwelt moſt upon the thoughts of it, and moſt applyed it; then preſently ſome deſperate temptation hath aſſaulted me, or ſett upon me; and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hath made this advantage of it. This cometh by your looking ſo much to the grace of God; doe you not ſee what effects come of it? were you not more reſtrained &amp;c. when you looked more to the Covenant of workes.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. I obſerve that the enemy ſtriketh at faith by every temptation: <hi>ex. gr.</hi> after ſome ſlip or fall; what, you a Childe of God, how can it be, and give ſuch way to temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Tempter hath (in my experience) appeared to be a lyar and full of malice, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred times, in his temptations.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. I have obſerved that Satan hath faſtened the ſame temptation upon ſeverall parties at one and the ſame time: <hi>ex. gr.</hi> I have had a ſtrong perſwaſion that ſuch and ſuch were offended at me, and by conference it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that they have had the ſame apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons faſtened upon them concerning me; and ſo there hath been mutuall ſtrangenes and ſhuning ſociety each with other.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. When the adverſary hath a deſigne to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119891:123"/>tempt to ſuch or ſuch an evill, he maketh way for it beforehand: <hi>ex. gr.</hi> ke knoweth that when ſuch parties meet together, there will be an occaſion for paſſions to ſtirre, he will caſt in ſomewhat before, which ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly moove ſuch paſſions, as, anger, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. I have frequently found that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my will caſt in ſuch and ſuch thoughts, as of blaſphemy againſt the Lord &amp;c. and then labour to perſwade me, that I am ſuch a one, and ſo maketh way for further temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. I have been much ſtirred up to bewaile and mourne over ſuch corrupt affections, and to ſtrive againſt them, and to goe to the death of Chriſt by faith for power to ſubdue them, to watch alſo and Covenant againſt them &amp;c. but all on a ſudden they have been revived, and if temptation have prevailed, then they have been improved thus; What overtaken againe? after all this it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible you ſhould be pardoned.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. I have often obſerved that the tempter will alwayes improve his ſucceſſes: if he gaine but a little ground, he followeth on with renewed force, with much fury, aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with violent impulſions, and taketh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage upon yeelding: as, you have yeelded ſo farre, and why not altogether?</p>
